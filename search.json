To avoid this, open your ~/.bashrc file:\ncode ~/.bashrc\nAnd append the following lines:\n# Do NOT add anything to this file, use `~/.bash_profile` instead.\n# The next line automatically loads your `~/.bash_profile`\n# any time a program tries to read your `~/.bashrc` file.\nif [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then . ~/.bash_profile; fi\nThe comment is a reminder to your future self who might open up this file a few months from now =)"

There is a community-driven effort called the conda-forge (read more here), which provides more up to date packages. Conda-forge is already set up when we installed Miniforge3\nTo install packages individually, we can now use the following command: conda install &lt;package-name&gt;. After running that command conda will show you the packages that will be downloaded, and you can press enter to proceed with the installation. If you want to answer yes by default and skip this confirmation step, you can replace conda install with conda install -y. Also note that we may occasionally need to install packages using pip, the standard Python package manager. The installation command is very similar to that of conda: pip install &lt;package-name&gt;.\nIn the next session we will use conda to install some of the key packages we will use in DSCI 310."

There is a community-driven effort called the conda-forge (read more here), which provides more up to date packages. Conda-forge is already set up when we installed Miniforge3\nTo install packages individually, we can now use the following command: conda install &lt;package-name&gt;. After running that command conda will show you the packages that will be downloaded, and you can press enter to proceed with the installation. If you want to answer yes by default and skip this confirmation step, you can replace conda install with conda install -y. Also note that we may occasionally need to install packages using pip, the standard Python package manager. The installation command is very similar to that of conda: pip install &lt;package-name&gt;.\nIn the next session we will use conda to install some of the key packages we will use in DSCI 310."

To obtain the latest R packages, we need to add a new repository which is maintained directly by the r-project.

In case you have already installed R using conda you can remove it by executing conda uninstall r-base.\n\n\n\nRStudio\nDownload the Ubuntu 22 Desktop version (not Pro) of RStudio from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Open the file and follow the installer instructions.\n\nNote: If you select “open with” and try to open the file directly with the Ubuntu Software app instead of downloading it first, the software app might complain that the file is not supported.\n\nTo see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon or typing rstudio in a terminal.\n\nNote: Since we installed RStudio directly from a deb file rather than from a repository or a snap package, it will not be updated when we run sudo apt upgrade and not automatically as for snap packages. Instead, RStudio will notify you of any available updates when the program is launched.\n\nNow we are going to change RStudio’s Insert Pipe shortcut so that it inserts the new native pipe operator |&gt;. Go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code &gt; Editing and tick the following option:\n\nOnce the change is made you can try in the RStudio console Control + Shift + m to check if works.\nFinally, let’s install a common R package that you used a lot in DSCI 100 by typing the following into the console inside RStudio:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nIRkernel\nThe IRkernel package is needed to make R work in Jupyter notebooks. To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install by pasting the following command into the RStudio Console:\ninstall.packages('IRkernel')\nIRkernel::installspec()\n\nNote: If you see an error message saying “jupyter-client has to be installed…”, close RStudio and run the following line from your terminal instead R -e \"IRkernel::installspec()\".\n\nTo see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel. To launch JupyterLab, type the following in a terminal:\njupyter lab\nA browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on “R” notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.\n\nSometimes a kernel loads, but doesn’t work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type library(tidyverse) in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:\n\nTo improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab, we will add keyboard shortcuts for inserting the common R operators &lt;- and |&gt;. Go to Settings -&gt; Settings Editor. Then click JSON Settings Editor in the top right corner and click on Keyboard Shortcuts in the navigation panel to the left. You will see two panels, the right-most panel allows you to perform advanced modification of keyboards shortcuts in JupyterLab and it already contains quite a few shortcuts. We’re going to add two more shortcuts, by pasting a text snippet just before the first existing shortcut. Go ahead and create a new line just after the line that says \"shortcuts\": [ and paste the following:\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Alt -\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"&lt;- \"}\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Accel Shift M\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"|&gt; \"}\n            }\n        },\nAfter you have pasted this text, hit the small floppy disk in the top right (or Ctrl + s) to save the settings. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like with the settings saved:\n\nTo check that the extension is working, open JupyterLab, launch an R notebook, and try inserting the operators by pressing Alt + - or Shift + Ctrl + m, respectively.

Decoupling these two code bases will allow for those functions to more easily be reused in future projects by you and others who might find them useful!\nYour new version control repository for your packaged functions should:\n\nbe given a name relevant to the functions it contains (just like the data science packages you know and love are).\nbe in the DSCI-310-2025 organization: https://github.com/DSCI-310-2025\ncontain at least 3 or 4 useful functions that handle errors gracefully (you already wrote these - you need to now copy them from your analysis repository to the software package repository)\nbe well documented (use the three level of package documentation we learned about in class: function/reference docs, vignette/tutorials docs, and high-level package website docs)\nhave unit and integration tests (you already wrote these - you need to now copy them from your analysis repository to the software package repository)\nuse GitHub actions for continuous integration to run your tests, and continuous deployment to render your package documentation (if you are creating a Python package, you can even use continuous deployment to publish your package to PyPI!)\nhave a badge for a code coverage\nhave a README that describes your package from a high-level, including where it sits in the package ecosystem for the language you chose to write it in chose (i.e., what other similar packages exist and how do they differ)\nhave a Software Licence that describes how you will permit others to use your work\nhave a code of conduct document that describes behavioural expectations of team interactions\nhave a contributions document that outlines how the team will work together (expected workflow practices)\n\nYou should update your the analysis code in your data analysis repository so that:\n\nyou load your R (or Python) package to access your functions, instead of sourcing or importing files in your analysis repository\nremove the files that contain your functions (you no longer need these since you are loading them from your package), and the tests directory files that holds the tests and the helper data for those tests (again, these should now exist in your package repository)\nupdate your projects computational environment so that it contains your R (or Python) package. Don’t forget to include the version when doing this!\n\n\n\nAdd data validation checks to the analysis pipeline\nTo ensure that your data visualization and modeling results are correct, robust and of high quality, we want you to add data validation checks to your data analysis. These should be written as code in your data analysis. Ensure you cover the checks we recommend in our Data validation checklist. For this milestone you must do at least 8 of the checks listed.\nAlso be thoughtful about what you want to happen if/when your checks fail, and be sure that your code reflects that. Finally, when implementing your checks, be sure they do not create data leakage between the training and test set.\n\n\nAddress any feedback received in earlier milestones and during peer review\nRevise your data analysis project to address feedback received from the DSCI 310 teaching team from past milestones, as well as feedback received from the peer review. 50% of your final grade for this milestone will be assessing whether you have addressed this feedback to improve your project.\nTo help us easily, and correctly, assess this, please create a GitHub issue in your analysis project’s GitHub repository with the title “Feedback addressed”. In this issue describe any improvements you made to the project based on feedback, and point to evidence of these improvements. You can point us to evidence of addressing it by providing URLs to reference specific lines of code, commit messages, pull requests, etc. Be sure to add some narration when sharing these URLs so that it is easy for us to identify which changes to your work addressed which pieces of feedback.",

Address any issues with your document or code from Milestone 1\nThese milestones build on one another, addressing issues from the previous milestone will make moving on to the next one easier.\n\n\n1. Upgrade your project’s computational environment to a container.\nWrite a Dockerfile to create a custom container for the computational environment for your project. Build your container using GitHub Actions, and publish your container image on DockerHub. Once this is done, shift the development of your project from working in a virtual environment to working in a container!\nThe Dockerfile is the file used to specify and create the Docker image from which containers can be run to create an reproducible computational environment for your analysis. For this project, we recommend using a base Docker image that already has most of the software dependencies needed for your analysis. Examples of these include the Jupyter core team Docker images (documentation) and the Rocker team Docker images (documentation). When you add other software dependencies to this Dockerfile, ensure that you pin the version of the software that you add.\nNote - this document should live in the root of your public GitHub.com repository.\nIn this milestone, we expect you to add a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the image, push it to DockerHub, and version the image (using the corresponding GitHub SHA) and GitHub repo when changes are pushed to the Dockerfile.\nYou will need to add your DockerHub username and password (naming them DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD, respectively) as GitHub secrets to this repository for this to work. This part is similar to Individual Assignment 2.\nAdditionally, document how to use your container image in your README. This is important to make it easy for you and your team to shift to a container solution for your computational environment. We highly recommend using Docker Compose so that launching your containers is as frictionless as possible (which makes you more likely to use this tool in your workflow)!\n\n\n2. Abstract more code from your literate code document (*.ipynb, *.Rmd, or .qmd) to scripts (e.g., .R or .py).\nThis code need not be converted to a function, but can simply be files that call the functions needed to run your analysis. You should aim to split the analysis code into 4, or more, R or Python scripts. Where the code in each script is contributing to a related step in your analysis.\nThe output of the first script must be the input of the second, and so on. All scripts should have command line arguments and we expect you to use either the docopt R package or the click Python package for parsing command line arguments.\nThey scripts could be organized something like this:\n\nA first script that downloads the data from the internet and saves it locally. This should take at least two arguments:\n\nthe path to the input file (a URL or a relative local path, such as data/file.csv), as well as\na path/filename where to write the file to and what to call it (e.g., data/cleaned_data.csv).\n\nNote: choose more descriptive filenames than the ones used above. These are general for illustrative purposes.\nA second script that reads the data from the first script and performs and data cleaning/pre-processing, transforming, and/or partitioning that needs to happen before exploratory data analysis or modeling takes place. This should take at least two arguments:\n\na path/filename pointing to the data to be read in\na path/filename pointing to where the cleaned/processed/transformed/partitioned data should live.\n\nA third script which creates exploratory data visualization(s) and table(s) that are useful to help the reader/consumer understand that data set. These analysis artifacts should be written to files. This should take at least two arguments:\n\na path/filename pointing to the data,\na path/filename prefix where to write the figure to and what to call it (e.g., results/this_eda.png).\n\nA fourth script that reads the data from the second script, performs the modeling and summarizes the results as a figure(s) and a table(s). These analysis artifacts should be written to files. This should take at least two arguments:\n\na path/filename pointing to the data\na path/filename prefix where to write the figure(s)/table(s) to and what to call it (e.g., results/this_analysis)\n\n\n\n\n3. Convert your *.ipynb or *.Rmd files into a Quarto document (*.qmd). Edit your Quarto document so that it’s sole job is to narrate your analysis, display your analysis artifacts (i.e., figures and tables), and nicely format the report\nThe goal is that non-data scientists would not be able to tell that code was used to perform your analysis or format your report (i.e., no code should be visible in the rendered report). You should do all the things you did for the report in individual assignment 4, including:\n\nUse markdown headers and Quarto configuration so that a table of contents will be created when the document is rendered.\nAdd correctly formatted inline bibtex references so that a nicely formatted reference list will be present at the end of the document.\nEdit the figure formatting so that Quarto:\n\nautomatically numbers them,\nhas a label for easy cross referencing, and\ncontrols the figure sizes so the figures are not too big.\n\nAdd a table description argument so that they are automatically numbered by Quarto and use cross referencing to link to the table if/when it is discussed in the text.\nEdit the narrative so it uses cross-referencing to refer to the figures and tables instead of having their reference hardcode the figure and table numbers.\nReplace any hard-coded values in the Quarto report narrative text with inline Quarto code, so that the text will be automatically updated with the correct value.\nChange the code chunk options so that no code is viewable in the rendered report, just the code outputs where needed (e.g., figures and tables).\n\n\n\n4. Write another script, a Makefile (literally called Makefile), to act as a driver script to rule them all\nThis script should run the others in sequence, hard coding in the appropriate arguments. This script should:\n\nlive in the project’s root directory and be named Makefile\nbe well documented (using the project README and comments inside the Makefile to explain what it does and how to use it)\nhave a all target so that you can easily run the entire analysis from top to bottom by running make all at the command line\nhave a clean target so that you can easily “undo” your analysis by running make clean at the command line (e.g., deletes all generate data and files).\n\nTip:\n\nThe all target can be a .PHONY target\nYou can create other targets that link up all the dependencies\n\nFor example, data, analysis, figures, pdf, etc, so your build process only runs what’s necessary during development\n\n\n\n\n5. Continue to manage issues professionally\nContinue managing issues effectively through project boards and milestones, make it clear who is responsible for what and what project milestone each task is associated with. In particular, create an issue for each task and/or sub-task needed for this milestone. Each of these issues must be assigned to a single person on the team. We want all of you to get coding experience in the project and each team member should be responsible for an approximately equal portion of the code.",

For example, Rscript -e \"print('something to say...')\". Make sure to change the double quotes \"\" to single quotes '' in the R code.\nHint: You will need to first install the {remotes} package, and then use the remotes::install_version() function\n\n\nBuild your Dockerfile and test it locally.\nAdd a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the image, push it to DockerHub, and version the image and GitHub repo when changes are pushed to the Dockerfile\n\nUse the “Docker image” workflow\n\nYou can also start off with an empty file and paste in a workflow by clicking “Skip this and setup a workflow yourself”.\n\nYou will need to add your DockerHub username and password (naming them DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD, respectively) as GitHub secrets to this repository for this to work.\nHere are some resources to help you create your own Github Action Workflow:\n\nGithub Actions Docker reference: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images\n\n\n\n(As Needed): Make sure you make at least one change to the Dockerfile once the GitHub Actions have been setup so that you get the image automatically built and pushed to DockerHub at least once. - You can also add a workflow_dispatch: trigger and manually trigger a workflow\n\nNote: If you are making an renv.lock file and you notice it’s not updating with renv::snapshot(), take a look at this FAQ",

    "text": "The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that everyone gains hands-on practice creating reproducible reports using Quarto.\nThroughout the pre-requisites for DSCI 310, you have become familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks to interweave narration and runnable code into a single document. This allowed you to pass your analysis over to a co-worker or reviewer, who could reproduce your work by running your notebook from top to bottom.\nBut are Jupyter Notebooks all there is to creating reproducible reports? Not entirely… For example, Jupyter Notebooks struggle with organization and configuration. Imagine you have an extremely long and complicated report packed into a single Jupyter Notebook. Writing out a table of contents, formatting a bibliography, and adding labels to figures can become extremely cumbersome, especially as they evolve with your analysis during the review process.\nImagine you have 25 figures and tables labelled 1 to 25 and you decide to add a new figure at the very start of your report; figure 1 now needs to be renamed to figure 2, table 2 now needs to be renamed to table 3, figure 3 now needs to be renamed to figure 4…\nThis is where Quarto (and related tools) can come in handy.

    "text": "The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that everyone gains hands-on practice creating reproducible reports using Quarto.\nThroughout the pre-requisites for DSCI 310, you have become familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks to interweave narration and runnable code into a single document. This allowed you to pass your analysis over to a co-worker or reviewer, who could reproduce your work by running your notebook from top to bottom.\nBut are Jupyter Notebooks all there is to creating reproducible reports? Not entirely… For example, Jupyter Notebooks struggle with organization and configuration. Imagine you have an extremely long and complicated report packed into a single Jupyter Notebook. Writing out a table of contents, formatting a bibliography, and adding labels to figures can become extremely cumbersome, especially as they evolve with your analysis during the review process.\nImagine you have 25 figures and tables labelled 1 to 25 and you decide to add a new figure at the very start of your report; figure 1 now needs to be renamed to figure 2, table 2 now needs to be renamed to table 3, figure 3 now needs to be renamed to figure 4…\nThis is where Quarto (and related tools) can come in handy. Although they have their own set of disadvantages, they are certainly an improvement over plain Jupyter Notebooks.

DSCI 310 aims to further students’ existing data science knowledge with reproducible and trustworthy workflows in the areas of creating and deploying data analysis, reports, and software. Particular focus will be placed on teaching the skills and tools currently used in academic research and industry settings.\nWithout deliberate and conscious effort towards project organization, tool choice, and workflows, complex and large data science projects can quickly grow out-of-hand and become irreproducible and untrustworthy. This course will focus on reproducible and trustworthy workflows for writing computer scripts, analytic reports and data analysis pipelines, as well as packaging, automated testing and deployment of software written for data analysis. An emphasis is also placed on how to collaborate effectively with others using version control tools, such as Git and GitHub. Such workflows act to mitigate chaos and maximize transparency, reproducibility, and productivity.\nWhile the course will be based on the use of the two leading languages in data science, Python and R, and related current tools (conda, Docker, Git, GitHub, Jupyter, etc.), the concepts and skills taught in the course aim to be discipline and tool agnostic, focussing on the importance of reproducible and trustworthy workflows for data analysis and the implications of failing to implement these when performing a data analysis.\nStudents who have completed this course will be able to complete complex data analysis projects with minimal technical debt – meaning that others can transparently follow how the analysis was done, reproduce the analysis for themselves if desired, and easily pickup on, and further extend the analysis in new areas. Strategies for collaboration on data science projects will also be emphasized."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nCode of Conduct\nAll participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing, you are expected to read and follow the DSCI 310 Code of Conduct.\n\n\nLate registration\nStudents who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.\n\n\nLate assignments / mid-term exam absence\nStudents must be present at the invigilation venue (in class, on Zoom, examination centre, etc) to take the mid-term exam; otherwise they will be considered to have missed the mid-term exam and will be assigned a grade of zero.\nStudents who will miss the mid-term exam must provide a self-declaration prior to the mid-term exam and make arrangements (e.g., schedule an oral make-up mid-term exam) with the Instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the mid-term exam will result in a grade of zero.\nA late submission is defined as any work submitted after the deadline. For a late submission, the student will receive a 75% scaling of their grade for the first occurrence, 50% scaling of their grade for the second occurrence, and will receive a grade of 0 for subsequent occurrences.\nStudents who miss an assignment or quiz can request an academic concession. From the UBC Senate policy on academic concession, grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate grounds, from the above policy, include “a traumatic event experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; an act of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; a death in the family or of a close friend.”\nTo request an academic concession, students should immediately email a completed and signed academic concession form to the course Instructor. Upon receiving the form, the Instructor will make a decision about how to proceed. Failure to present valid documentation may result in a failing grade.\n\n\nRe-grading\nIf you have concerns about the way your work was graded, please contact the TA who graded it within one week of having the grade returned to you through Piazza. After this one-week window, we may deny your request for re-evaluation. Also, please keep in mind that your grade may go up or down as a result of re-grading.\n\n\nMissed final exam\nStudents who miss the final quiz must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.\n\n\nAcademic concession policy\nPlease see UBC’s concession policy for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework, quizzes, and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.\nA more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code by automatic code-generation software\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\nThe above attribution policy applies only to assignments. No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during a quiz or exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related question.\nRepeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course."

Draft a team work contract\nThis document will govern the working relationships on your team, and if done correctly, it should help you manage and resolve any issues that might arise when working in a group. A sample team work contract from a past data science project can be found here.\nA team work contract communicates specifically how the core group of people who are working together and gives detail about the logistics of working together and the expectations you have for each other.\nSome aspects of the team work contract could be:\n\nHow will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?\nWhat are the expected work hours for the project?\nHow often will group meetings occur (here is a nice article on meetings)?\nWill you have meeting agendas and minutes? If so, what will be the system for rotating through these responsibilities?\nWhat will be the style of working?\n\nWill you start each day with stand-ups, or submit a summary of your contributions 4 hours before each meeting? or something else?\n\nWhat is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?\nWhen are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).\nAnd any other similar things that govern your working relationships.\n\nUse this opportunity to use your prior knowledge/experience to improve your teamwork, communication, leadership, and organizational skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis document is fairly personal and does NOT need to reside in your public GitHub.com repo.\nPlease submit this contract under a separate assignment.\n\n\n\n\n2. Set-up a GitHub repository\nNow set-up a public GitHub repository for your project in the format: dsci-310-group-XX-&lt;optional_team_name&gt;. You will create this project in the course github organization (not under a personal account).\nWe are using github.com and public repositories because we will eventually be using some fancy tooling (e.g., GitHub Actions) in this project. For this to work, all your work for this project (including scripts) should be developed and live in this repository on GitHub.com. Additionally, this will help you build a portfolio of your work you can share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you need to change the name of your project repository later, you can.\n\n\nThe tracking of the project will be done using GitHub milestones. When you create a milestone, you can associate it with issues and pull requests. After creating issues you can link them to a milestone associating each them to a project due date.\nIn order to make more efficient team workflow, organize the issues you have previously associated with milestones into a GitHub project board.\nThe project board should show the current status of the project to the team. Each collaborator is responsible of converting the issues to cards and then moving them through the board columns as the project evolves.\n\n\n3. Select a data analysis project to work with\nThe content of this analysis project should be a narrated analysis that asks and answers a predictive question using a classification or regression method taught in the prerequisite course, DSCI 100. For milestone 1, the code and analysis narrative should be contained within a single Jupyter notebook (e.g., .ipynb file), RMarkdown file (e.g., .Rmd file), or Quarto document (e.g., .qmd file). The analysis narrative should be rich, and at the level of the final project from DSCI 100. Either R or Python can be used to do this. However, all group members must have past experience using the language chosen and permission of the instructor must be given. The restrictions on the analysis methods and programming language are put in place to ensure that all group members can contribute equally to the project.\nThe data for the project should be publicly available, and clearly licensed to be shared and used openly on the internet. We strongly suggest you avoid using data sets where authentication is needed for access (e.g., Kaggle) as this adds another layer of complexity when making these projects reproducible.\n\nPossible data set sources\n\npast DSCI 100 projects (note: if you reuse part or all of a past DSCI 100 project, you will be required to provide documentation of written permission of all past teammates from that project)\nUCI Machine Learning Repository: Data Sets\nfivethirtyeight R package (if you use this, see the note below!)\nGovernment of Canada open data\nGitHub repo of awesome public datasets\ntidytuesday data set\nGoogle Data set search engine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you choose a data set from the fivethirtyeight R package, you cannot copy their scientific question, visualizations or methods from the original FiveThirtyEight articles from where the data sets were first reported on. Finally, with the fivethirtyeight R package data sets, we want you to get practice reading them using the read_* functions in R or Python, so please use the versions of the data sets listed here: https://github.com/rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight/tree/master/data-raw\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Create an appropriate file and directory structure for a data analysis project\nFor this project, you are expected to follow the best practices we have learned about in regards to project directory and file structures. This should be reflected in your GitHub repository. Specifically for this milestone, please ensure that you include at least the following 7 files and directories in your project’s GitHub repository:\n\nREADME.md\nCODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\nCONTRIBUTING.md\ndata/\nanalysis.Rmd or analysis.qmd\nDockerfile\n.github/workflows/publish_docker_image.yml\nLICENSE.md\n\nThe description of each of them follows.\n\ni. README.md\nIn the main README.md file for this project you should include: - the project title - the list of contributors/authors - a short summary of the project (view from 10,000 feet) - how to run your data analysis - a list of the dependencies needed to run your analysis - the names of the licenses contained in LICENSE.md\nNote - this document should live in the root of your public GitHub.com repo.\n\n\nii. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\nIn an attempt to create a safe, positive, productive, and happy community, many organizations and developers create a code of conduct for their projects. A code of conduct in a Data Science project informs others of social norms, acceptable behaviour and general etiquette. It is more outward facing than the team work contract discussed above. We recommend Project Include for a comprehensive guide to writing an effective Code of Conduct.\nAt minimum, we believe that a good/effective code of conduct should include:\n\nA Statement on diversity and inclusivity\nDetails on expected, and unacceptable behaviour\nA list of consequences for unacceptable behaviour\nA procedure for reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour\n\n\nSample Codes of Conduct:\n\nUBC Data Science 100 CoC\nidocde Coc\nPython Community CoC\nTidyverse CoC\nPandas CoC\nVox Media CoC\n\nNote - this document should live in the root of your public GitHub.com repository.\n\n\n\niii. CONTRIBUTING.md\nIt is a good practice to include information about how others outside the core team can contribute to your project somewhere in your repository. This is typically done as a separate file in a repository called CONTRIBUTING.md. Here are some examples of this file:\n\nAltair\ndplyr\nAtom editor (very comprehensive)\n\nIf you’re interested in this, here’s a quick guide to creating this file from GitHub, but in the meantime, you can use the following snippet as a template:\nWe welcome all contributions to this project!\nIf you notice a bug, or have a feature request,\nplease open up an issue [here](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/REPOSITORY_NAME/issues).\nIf you'd like to contribute a feature or bug fix,\nyou can fork our repo and submit a pull request.\nWe will review pull requests within 7 days.\nAll contributors must abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nNote - this document should live in the root of your public GitHub.com repository.\n\n\niv. data/\nThe data directory should contain a copy of the downloaded data (written there by code). An exception to this can be made if the data set is extremely large (&gt; 100 MB per file). In such cases, please reach out to the instructional team to make an alternative plan.\n\n\nv. analysis.ipynb / analysis.Rmd / analysis.qmd\nFor this milestone, the analysis code and narration should be contained within a single literate code document (e.g., Jupyter notebook, RMarkdown file, or Quarto document). This document should not actually be named analysis.***, but have a more descriptive title, related to the project title.\n\n\nvi. Dockerfile\nThe Dockerfile is the file used to specify and create the Docker image from which containers can be run to create an reproducible computational environment for your analysis. For this project, we recommend using a base Docker image that already has most of the software dependencies needed for your analysis. Examples of these include the Jupyter core team Docker images (documentation) and the Rocker team Docker images (documentation). When you add other software dependencies to this Dockerfile, ensure that you pin the version of the software that you add.\nNote - this document should live in the root of your public GitHub.com repository.\n\n\nvii. .github/workflows/publish_docker_image.yml\nIn this milestone, we expect you to add a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the image, push it to DockerHub, and version the image (using latest is okay for now) and GitHub repo when changes are pushed to the Dockerfile\nYou will need to add your DockerHub username and password (naming them DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD, respectively) as GitHub secrets to this repository for this to work.\nThis part is similar to Individual Assignment 3.\n\n\nviii. LICENSE.md\nLicense’s tell others how they may (or may not) use your work. We will learn more about licenses later in the course, and for now we recommend using an MIT license for the project code and a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license for the project report. As long as your group agrees, these can be changed later in the course when you learn more about licenses. If you want to spend some time choosing different licenses now, we can recommend these two websites to help get you started:\n\nhttps://choosealicense.com/\nhttps://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/\n\n\n\n\n5. Add the data analysis as a literate code document\nFor this milestone, the analysis code and narration should be contained within a single literate code document (i.e., Jupyter notebook). The following sections should be included:\n\nTitle\nSummary\nIntroduction:\n\nprovide some relevant background information on the topic so that someone unfamiliar with it will be prepared to understand the rest of your report\nclearly state the question you tried to answer with your project\nidentify and describe the dataset that was used to answer the question\n\nMethods & Results:\n\ndescribe in written english the methods you used to perform your analysis from beginning to end that narrates the code the does the analysis.\nyour report should include code which:\nloads data from the original source on the web\nwrangles and cleans the data from it’s original (downloaded) format to the format necessary for the planned classification or clustering analysis\nperforms a summary of the data set that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned classification analysis\ncreates a visualization of the dataset that is relevant for exploratory data analysis related to the planned classification analysis\nperforms classification or regression analysis\ncreates a visualization of the result of the analysis\nnote: all tables and figure should have a figure/table number and a legend\n\nDiscussion:\n\nsummarize what you found\ndiscuss whether this is what you expected to find?\ndiscuss what impact could such findings have?\ndiscuss what future questions could this lead to?\n\nReferences:\n\nat least 4 citations relevant to the project (format is your choose, just be consistent across the references).\n\n\n\n\n6. Make the computation environment reproducible through containerization with Docker\nFor this project, we will be making the computation environment reproducible through containerization with Docker. We will use Docker containers for collaborative project development, as well as for sharing a reproducible analysis at the end of the project. It is expected that: - the Docker image, from which containers are generated, will be specified by a Dockerfile that lives in the root of the project’s GitHub repository - the building of the Docker image and distribution of it via DockerHub will be automated via GitHub Actions - an explanation of how to run and use Docker to develop and execute the analysis will be documented in the README.md file.",

    "text": "Milestone 3 summary\nIn this milestone, you will:\n\nAbstract some code from your scripts to functions in a separate file, and write tests for those functions\nContinue to manage issues professionally\n\n\n1. Abstract some code from your scripts to functions in a separate file, and write tests for those functions\nIn every data science project, there is some code that is repetitive, and other code that may not be repetitive in the current project, but would likely be very useful in other, related future projects. It is well worth it to abstract such code to functions, making it easily reuseable in the future in other work. Examples of code that often repetitive in a data analysis projects:\n\ndata wrangling, cleaning or transformation code that gets applied to multiple columns or multiple data sets\ndata visualization code when many versions of a similar plot-type is used (e.g., many scatter plots with similar formatting)\ndata modeling workflow/pipeline code when tuning different models on the same data set\n\nAbstracting our analysis code into functions also makes it testable! Meaning you can assess whether your code works as expected. This alone is reason enough to use functions in your analysis code.\nYour job here is to create at least 3-4 functions from your scripts. One per group member is the minimum. When doing this task, follow the workflow for writing functions and tests for data science, remember this process will include:\n\nwriting thorough function specifications & documentation\nwriting robust unit tests for these functions to ensure they work as expected\nwriting the code that makes up the function body\n\nIf you are using R, these functions will live in an .R file (whose filename will be named after the function, or functions). It is OK to have one function per file, or all functions in one file. This/these file(s) will live in a sub-directory called R. If you are using Python, these functions will live in an .py file (whose filename will be named after the function, or functions). Again, it is OK to have one function per file, or all functions in one file. This/these file(s) will live in a sub-directory called src.\nYou will source (in the case of R) or import (in the case of Python) these functions in your scripts to use them in your analysis. Tests will live in a test directory, with files/subdirectories organized as per the testing framework you are using. If you are using R for your data analysis code, we expect you to use the testthat R package framework for writing software tests. If you are using Python, we expect you to use the pytest Python package framework.\nOf course, if it makes sense to have more than 3-4 you are welcome to increase the number! However, all functions must have the same standards in regards to software robustness.

Continue to manage issues professionally\nContinue managing issues effectively through project boards and milestones, make it clear who is responsible for what and what project milestone each task is associated with. In particular, create an issue for each task and/or sub-task needed for this milestone. Each of these issues must be assigned to a single person on the team. We want all of you to get coding experience in the project and each team member should be responsible for an approximately equal portion of the code.",

If team members cannot complete their sections within the maximum hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the group submission date (Saturday 6am) to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.\nAll submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the milestones as set out in the instructions. This includes making sure all scripts are working, creating tests for all your functions, and using proper grammar in written submissions.\nMeetings\nMeeting times were established during the initial team meeting held on 202X-XX-XX. Meetings will be held in or meet outside LOCATION on the following dates:\n\nThursday 2/27: 4-5pm\nMonday 3/2: 4-5pm (if needed)\nThursday 3/5: 1-2pm\nMonday 3/9: 4-5pm (if needed)\nWednesday 3/11: 12:30-2pm\nThursday 3/12: 4-5pm (if needed)\nMonday 3/16: 4-5pm (if needed)\nThursday 3/19: 1-2pm\nThursday 3/19 (same day): 4-5pm (if needed)\nThursday 3/26: 10am - 1pm\n\nThe group will have a second formal meeting during the lab for 524 on Mondays at 2 pm. All members are expected to attend the meetings. If a member cannot make a meeting, written notice must be given 24 hours before the meeting to discuss alternative options.\nCommunication\nAll communication outside of the meetings will be through Slack or Github. Github will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work and reviewing work. Slack will be the primary communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.\nReviews\nAll members are expected to submit a pull request for their work on the repository for the group project on Github.com. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull request reviewed by another teammate. Pull request should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.\nRoles\nThere are two roles team members will be responsible for each week. The roles are as follows:\n\nScribe:\n\nResponsible for taking notes at the meetings and in-class lab sessions and adding as a GitHub issue.\nResponsible for sharing with all notes and in-class activities to teammates.\n\nProof-reader\n\nResponsible for doing a final check of the submission before the deadline to make sure all requirements are satisfied.\n\n\nPositions will be rotated each week to ensure that each team member does each position once.\nDeadlines\nDeadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. The proof-reader will review the work on Saturday and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.\nBreach of Contract\nFailure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:\n\nThe first step is a written notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.\nThe second step is a meeting to discuss the behaviour and write an agreement to follow the team contract is required by the member.\nThe third step is to reach out to the lab instructor or TAs of the issues with the teammate",

Briefly, we will be using the Bash shell to interact with our computers via a command line interface, Git to keep a version history of our files and upload to/download from to GitHub, and Windows Terminal to run the both Bash and Git.\nGo to https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the windows version of git. After the download has finished, run the installer and accept the default configuration for all pages except for the following:\n\nOn the Select Components page, add a Git Bash profile to Windows Terminal.\n\nOn the Choosing the default editor used by Git page, select “Use Visual Studio Code as Git’s default editor” from the drop-down menu’\n\nSet the default branch name to main\n\n\nTo install windows terminal visit this link and click Get to open it in Windows Store. Inside the Store, click Get again and then click Install.\n\nNote: Some Windows 11 users might have Windows Terminal installed by default, and so it might appear that nothing is installed when they follow these instructions. To confirm, hit Windows Key and then type terminal and confirm the terminal is there.\n\nAfter installation, click Launch to start Windows Terminal. In the top of the window, you will see the tab bar with one open tab, a plus sign, and a down arrow. Click the down arrow and select Settings (or type the shortcut Ctrl + ,). In the Startup section, click the dropdown menu under Default profile and select Git Bash.\n\nYou can now launch the Windows terminal from the start menu or pin it to the taskbar like any other program (you can read the rest of the article linked above for additional tips if you wish). To make sure everything worked, close down Windows Terminal, and open it again. Git Bash should open by default, the text should be green and purple, and the tab should read MINGW64:/c/Users/$USERNAME (you should also see /c/Users/$USERNAME if you type pwd into the terminal). This screenshot shows what it should look like:\n\n\nNote: Whenever we refer to “the terminal” in these installation instructions, we want you to use the Windows Terminal that you just installed with the Git Bash profile. Do not use Windows PowerShell, CMD, or anything else unless explicitly instructed to do so.\n\nTo open a new tab you can click the plus sign or use Ctrl + Shift + t (you can close a tab with Ctrl + Shift + w). To copy text from the terminal, you can highlight it with the mouse and then click Ctrl + Shift + c. To paste text you use Ctrl + Shift + v, try it by pasting the following into the terminal to check which version of Bash you just installed:\nbash --version\nThe output should look similar to this:\nGNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (x86_64-pc-msys)\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;\n\nThis is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nNote: If there is a newline (the enter character) in the clipboard when you are pasting into the terminal, you will be asked if you are sure you want to paste since this newline will act as if you pressed enter and run the command. As a guideline you can press Paste anyway unless you are sure you don’t want this to happen.\n\nLet’s also check which version of git was installed:\ngit --version\ngit version 2.52.0.windows.1\n\nNote: Some of the Git commands we will use are only available since Git 2.23, so make sure your if your Git is at least this version.\n\nYou can launch many windows programs from the terminal, e.g. to launch VS Code that we installed previously, you would type in code, let’s use this to check the version of vscode that we installed:\ncode --version\n1.107.1\n994fd12f8d3a5aa16f17d42c041e5809167e845a\nx64\n\nConfiguring Git user info\nNext, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email. To do this, type the following into the terminal (replacing Jane Doe and janedoe@example.com, with your name and email that you used to sign up for GitHub, respectively):\ngit config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\"\ngit config --global user.email janedoe@example.com\n\nNote: To ensure that you haven’t made a typo in any of the above, you can view your global Git configurations by either opening the configuration file in a text editor (e.g. via the command code ~/.gitconfig) or by typing git config --list --global.\n\n\n\nSetting VS Code as the default editor\nTo make programs run from the terminal (such as git) use VS Code by default, we will modify ~/.bash_profile. First, open it using VS Code:\ncode ~/.bash_profile\n\nNote: If you see any existing lines in your ~/.bash_profile related to a previous Python or R installation, please remove these.\n\nAppend the following lines:\n# Set the default editor for programs launch from terminal\nEDITOR=\"code --wait\"\nVISUAL=$EDITOR  # Use the same value as for \"EDITOR\" in the line above\nThen save the file and exit VS Code.\n\nNote: Most terminal programs will read the EDITOR environmental variable when determining which editor to use, but some read VISUAL, so we’re setting both to the same value.\n\nIn some cases, VScode is not set as the default text editor for git even after appending the two lines above, so to make sure it is registered properly, also run the following from your terminal:\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\nOn Windows, VScode sometimes reads a different configuration file than Git Bash. To avoid this, open your ~/.bashrc file:\ncode ~/.bashrc\nAnd append the following line:\n# Do NOT add anything to this file, use `~/.bash_profile` instead.\n# The next line automatically loads your `~/.bash_profile`\n# any time a program tries to read your `~/.bashrc` file.\nif [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then . ~/.bash_profile; fi\nThe comment is a reminder to your future self who might open up this file a few months from now =)\n\n\nSetting Git Bash as the default VS Code terminal profile\nFinally, let’s make sure the VS Code uses our newly installed Git Bash shell as its default terminal profile:\n\nOpen Up VS Code and go to the general preferences / settings (shortcut Ctrl + ,).\nType in “Default terminal profile” and find the entry that reads Terminal &gt; Integrated &gt; Default profile: Windows.\nSelect Git Bash from the drop down menu of this entry.\n\nNow Git Bash should be opened automatically each time you open a new terminal in side VS Code."

Make sure you use the Miniforge3 installers, not the other ones listed. We will assume you downloaded the file into your Downloads folder.\nOnce downloaded, run the installer.\nUse all the default options in the installer.\nThe install location should look something like: C:\\Users\\YOUR_USER_NAME\\miniforge3\n\nNote: Do not add miniforge to PATH. We will set this up later.\n\nAfter installation, open the Start Menu and search for the program called “Miniforge Prompt”. When this opens you will see a prompt similar to (base) C:\\Users\\your_name. Type the following to check that your Python installation is working:\npython --version\nwhich should return Python 3.12.0 or greater:\nPython 3.12.12\nIf not, run the following command in the Miniforge Prompt, Confirm that you are in the (base) environment. Then update the base python with:\nconda install python=3.12\n\n\nIntegrating Python with the Git Bash terminal\nTo avoid having to open the separate Miniforge Prompt every time we want to use Python, we can make it available from the (Git Bash) terminal, which is what we will be using most of the time. To set this up, open the “Miniforge Prompt” again and type:\nconda init bash\nYou will see that this modified a few configuration files, which makes conda visible to the terminal. Close all open terminal windows and launch a new one, you should now see that the prompt string has changed to include the word (base) as in the screenshot below:\n\nIf you type\npython --version\nyou should now see the same output as above:\nPython 3.12.12\nLet’s also check the version of the conda package manager. If you type\nconda --version\nyou should see something like this\nconda 25.11.1\n\nOptional: One annoyance with our current terminal setup is that the word (base) is not on the same row as the rest of the prompt string (the part with your_name@your_computer). To fix this we can edit the .bash_profile configuration file to indicate that we do not want a newline at the beginning of the prompt string. Open up the configuration file using VS Code by typing the following command into a terminal:\ncode \"/c/Program Files/Git/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh\"\nDelete the line that reads the following (it should be line 13, but could be elsewhere):\nPS1=\"$PS1\"'\\n'       # new line\nWhile we are in this file, let’s also remove the line that says PS1=\"$PS1\"'$MSYSTEM '          # show MSYSTEM (line 17), to remove some clutter from the terminal.\nClick to save the file, when VS Code prompts you that the saving failed, click “Retry as Admin” and then “Yes”. That’s it! Now if you launch a new terminal instance, you will see (base) on the same line as the rest of the prompt string as in the screenshot below."

If you want to answer yes by default and skip this confirmation step, you can replace conda install with conda install -y.

Open the file and follow the installer instructions.\nTo see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon.\nNext, we will make sure that Rstudio uses the same directories as R from terminal for its configuration. To do this, we will need to set an environmental variable in Windows. First, open the start menu, type “env” and select the match that reads “Edit the system environment variables”. Click the button at the bottom that reads “Environmental Variables…”:\n\nUnder “User variable” click the “New…” button:\n\nAnd type in R_USER as the “Variable name” and C:\\Users\\username as the “Variable value”, replacing username with your actual user name (if you don’t know your user name, look at the top of the screenshot above where it says “User variables for your_username”):\n\nClick “OK” on all of the three windows we opened above and you’re done!

Go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code &gt; Editing and tick the following option:\n\nOnce the change is made you can try in the RStudio console Ctrl + Shift + m to check if works.\nFinally, let’s install a common R package that you used a lot in DSCI 100 by typing the following into the console inside RStudio:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nRtools\nWindows users will also need to install Rtools, which will allow you to use external libraries.

Do not follow the Rtools’ website instructions for “Putting Rtools on the PATH”. RStudio will put Rtools on the PATH automatically when it is needed.\nTo test if your installation was successful, open RStudio (restart it if you already have it open) and type the following into the Console:\ninstall.packages(\"jsonlite\", type = \"source\")\nIf the jsonlite package installs without errors, Rtools is setup correctly.\n\n\nIRkernel\nThe IRkernel package is needed to make R work in Jupyter notebooks. To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install by pasting the following command into the RStudio Console:\ninstall.packages('IRkernel')\nNext, open the Windows terminal and type the following (you can’t use RStudio for this step since it doesn’t honor $PATH changes)\nR -e \"IRkernel::installspec()\"\nTo see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel. To launch the JupyterLab type the following in the terminal:\njupyter lab\nA browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on “R” notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.\n\nSometimes a kernel loads, but doesn’t work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type library(tidyverse) in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:\n\nTo improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab, we will add keyboard shortcuts for inserting the common R operators &lt;- and |&gt;. Go to Settings -&gt; Settings Editor. Then click JSON Settings Editor in the top right corner and click on Keyboard Shortcuts in the navigation panel to the left. You will see two panels, the right-most panel allows you to perform advanced modification of keyboards shortcuts in JupyterLab and it might already contain quite a few shortcuts. For some, the right side might be completely blank. We’re going to add two more shortcuts, by pasting a text snippet.\nIf the right side is completely blank, paste the following code:\n{\"shortcuts\":[\n]}\nWhether or not there are already settings, or you pasted the code above, now go ahead and create a new line just after the line that says \"shortcuts\": [ and paste the following code.\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Alt -\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"&lt;- \"}\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Accel Shift M\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"|&gt; \"}\n            }\n        },\nAfter you have pasted this text, hit the small floppy disk in the top right (or Ctrl + s) to save the settings. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like with the settings saved:\n\nTo check that the extension is working, open JupyterLab, launch an R notebook, and try inserting the operators by pressing Alt + - or Shift + Ctrl + m, respectively. You could add any arbitrary text insertion command the same way, but this is all that is required for this course."
