    "text": "Course description\nData science methods to automate the running and testing of code and analytic reports, manage data analysis software dependencies, package and deploy software for data analysis, and collaborate with others using version control.\nPre-reqs: DSCI 100 and either (a) one of CPSC 203, CPSC 210, CPEN 221 or (b) one of MATH 210, ECON 323 and one of CPSC 107, CPSC 110.\nSee the Faculty of Science Credit Exclusion Lists: www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,414\nLong version: Data Science skills and tools are increasingly in demand across a large variety of disciplines. DSCI 310 aims to further students’ existing data science knowledge with reproducible and trustworthy workflows in the areas of creating and deploying data analysis, reports, and software. Particular focus will be placed on teaching the skills and tools currently used in academic research and industry settings.\nWithout deliberate and conscious effort towards project organization, tool choice, and workflows, complex and large data science projects can quickly grow out-of-hand and become irreproducible and untrustworthy. This course will focus on reproducible and trustworthy workflows for writing computer scripts, analytic reports and data analysis pipelines, as well as packaging, automated testing and deployment of software written for data analysis. An emphasis is also placed on how to collaborate effectively with others using version control tools, such as Git and GitHub. Such workflows act to mitigate chaos and maximize transparency, reproducibility, and productivity.\nWhile the course will be based on the use of the two leading languages in data science, Python and R, and related current tools (conda, Docker, Git, GitHub, Jupyter, etc.), the concepts and skills taught in the course aim to be discipline and tool agnostic, focussing on the importance of reproducible and trustworthy workflows for data analysis and the implications of failing to implement these when performing a data analysis.\nStudents who have completed this course will be able to complete complex data analysis projects with minimal technical debt – meaning that others can transparently follow how the analysis was done, reproduce the analysis for themselves if desired, and easily pickup on, and further extend the analysis in new areas. Strategies for collaboration on data science projects will also be emphasized."

There are also individual assignments that act as stepping stones to the project milestones. Given that collaboration is so important in data science, a portion of your final grade will be an assessment of the evidence you provide that you were an effective and productive team member. A combination of peer evaluation and GitHub history will be used to evaluate this. Your individual knowledge on the course materials (concepts and practical skills) will be evaluated on two summative assessments (midterm and final exam).\nFinally, this course is delivered in a blended format, with some pre-work (video watching or reading) expected to be done before each lecture. These will be provided in the course Canvas shell. Each in class lecture session will start with iClicker cloud questions to probe your understanding of the pre-lecture material and then we will work through demonstrations and exercises in class to build off of this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade (%)\nLearning Objectives Addressed\n\n\n\n\niClicker cloud1\n1\n1 – 6\n\n\nIndividual assignments\n1\n1, 2, 4, 5\n\n\nProject milestone 1\n5\n3, 6\n\n\nProject milestone 2\n5\n3, 4, 6\n\n\nProject milestone 3\n5\n3, 4, 5, 6\n\n\nFinal project\n5\n3, 4, 5, 6\n\n\nPeer review\n2.5\n2\n\n\nTeamwork\n5\n6\n\n\nGitHub username quiz\n0.5\nNA\n\n\nMidterm exam2\n20\n1, 2, part of 4\n\n\nFinal exam3\n50\n1, 2, 4, 5\n\n\n\n1 We will be using iClicker cloud in the lectures regularly.

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nCode of Conduct\nAll participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing, you are expected to read and follow the DSCI 310 Code of Conduct.\n\n\nLate registration\nStudents who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.\n\n\nLate assignments / mid-term exam absence\nStudents must be present at the invigilation venue (in class, on Zoom, examination centre, etc) to take the mid-term exam; otherwise they will be considered to have missed the mid-term exam and will be assigned a grade of zero.\nStudents who will miss the mid-term exam must provide a self-declaration prior to the mid-term exam and make arrangements (e.g., schedule an oral make-up mid-term exam) with the Instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the mid-term exam will result in a grade of zero.\nA late submission is defined as any work submitted after the deadline. For a late submission, the student will receive a 75% scaling of their grade for the first occurrence, 50% scaling of their grade for the second occurrence, and will receive a grade of 0 for subsequent occurrences.\nStudents who miss an assignment or quiz can request an academic concession. From the UBC Senate policy on academic concession, grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate grounds, from the above policy, include “a traumatic event experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; an act of sexual assault or other sexual misconduct experienced by the student, a family member, or a close friend; a death in the family or of a close friend.”\nTo request an academic concession, students should immediately email a completed and signed academic concession form to the course Instructor. Upon receiving the form, the Instructor will make a decision about how to proceed. Failure to present valid documentation may result in a failing grade.\n\n\nRe-grading\nIf you have concerns about the way your work was graded, please contact the TA who graded it within one week of having the grade returned to you through Piazza. After this one-week window, we may deny your request for re-evaluation. Also, please keep in mind that your grade may go up or down as a result of re-grading.\n\n\nMissed final exam\nStudents who miss the final quiz must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.\n\n\nAcademic concession policy\nPlease see UBC’s concession policy for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework, quizzes, and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.\n\n\nAcademic integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.\nA more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code by automatic code-generation software\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\nThe above attribution policy applies only to assignments. No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during a quiz or exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related question.\nRepeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course."

First, open it using VS Code (this will also create the file if it doesn’t already exist):\ncode ~/.bash_profile\n\nNote: If you see any existing lines in your ~/.bash_profile related to a previous Python or R installation, please remove these.\n\nNow append the following lines to ~/.bash_profile:\n# Set the default editor for programs launch from terminal\nEDITOR=\"code --wait\"\nVISUAL=$EDITOR  # Use the same value as for \"EDITOR\" in the line above\nThen save the file and exit VS Code.\n\nNote: Most terminal programs will read the EDITOR environmental variable when determining which editor to use, but some read VISUAL, so we’re setting both to the same value.\n\nIn some cases, VScode is not set as the default text editor for git even after appending the two lines above, so to make sure it is registered properly, also run the following from your terminal:\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\nOn MacOS, VScode sometimes reads a different configuration file than your other programs. To avoid this, open your ~/.bashrc file:\ncode ~/.bashrc\nAnd append the following lines:\n# Do NOT add anything to this file, use `~/.bash_profile` instead.\n# The next line automatically loads your `~/.bash_profile`\n# any time a program tries to read your `~/.bashrc` file.\nif [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then . ~/.bash_profile; fi\nThe comment is a reminder to your future self who might open up this file a few months from now =)"

A package needs to go through thorough testing before it is included in the default channel, which is good for stability, but also means that new versions will be delayed and fewer packages are available overall. There is a community-driven effort called the conda-forge (read more here), which provides more up to date packages. To enable us to access the most up to date version of the Python packages we are going to use, we will add the more up to date channel. To add the conda-forge channel by typing the following in the terminal:\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nTo install packages individually, we can now use the following command: conda install &lt;package-name&gt;. After running that command conda will show you the packages that will be downloaded, and you can press enter to proceed with the installation. If you want to answer yes by default and skip this confirmation step, you can replace conda install with conda install -y. Also note that we may occasionally need to install packages using pip, the standard Python package manager. The installation command is very similar to that of conda: pip install &lt;package-name&gt;.\nLet’s try this out by installing a package that makes conda faster and changing the config to use this package by default:\nconda install conda-libmamba-solver\nconda config --set solver libmamba\nIn the next session we will use conda to install some of the key packages we will use in DSCI 310."

In case you have already installed R using conda you can remove it by executing conda uninstall r-base.\n\n\n\nXQuartz\nSome R packages rely on the dependency XQuartz which no longer ships with the Mac OS, thus we need to install it separately. Download it from here: https://www.xquartz.org/ and follow the installation instructions.\n\n\nRStudio\nDownload the macOS Desktop version (not Pro) of RStudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Open the file and follow the installer instructions.\nTo see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon (from Finder, Applications or Launchpad).\nNow we are going to change RStudio’s Insert Pipe shortcut so that it inserts the new native pipe operator |&gt;.

To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install by pasting the following command into the RStudio Console:\ninstall.packages('IRkernel')\nNext, open a terminal and type the following (you can’t use RStudio for this step since it doesn’t honor $PATH changes in ~/.bash_profile)\nR -e \"IRkernel::installspec()\"\nTo see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel. To launch JupyterLab, type the following in Terminal:\njupyter lab\nA browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on “R” notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.\n\nSometimes a kernel loads, but doesn’t work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type library(tidyverse) in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:\n\nTo improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab, we will add keyboard shortcuts for inserting the common R operators &lt;- and |&gt;. Go to Settings -&gt; Settings Editor. Then click JSON Settings Editor in the top right corner and click on Keyboard Shortcuts in the navigation panel to the left. You will see two panels, the right-most panel allows you to perform advanced modification of keyboards shortcuts in JupyterLab and it already contains quite a few shortcuts. We’re going to add two more shortcuts, by pasting a text snippet just before the first existing shortcut. Go ahead and create a new line just after the line that says \"shortcuts\": [ and paste the following:\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Alt -\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"&lt;- \"}\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Accel Shift M\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"|&gt; \"}\n            }\n        },\nAfter you have pasted this text, hit the small floppy disk in the top right (or Ctrl + s) to save the settings. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like with the settings saved:\n\nTo check that the extension is working, open JupyterLab, launch an R notebook, and try inserting the operators by pressing Alt + - or Command + Shift + m, respectively.

A package needs to go through thorough testing before it is included in the default channel, which is good for stability, but also means that new versions will be delayed and fewer packages are available overall. There is a community-driven effort called the conda-forge (read more here), which provides more up to date packages. To enable us to access the most up to date version of the Python packages we are going to use, we will add the more up to date channel. To add the conda-forge channel by typing the following in the terminal:\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nTo install packages individually, we can now use the following command: conda install &lt;package-name&gt;. After running that command conda will show you the packages that will be downloaded, and you can press enter to proceed with the installation. If you want to answer yes by default and skip this confirmation step, you can replace conda install with conda install -y. Also note that we may occasionally need to install packages using pip, the standard Python package manager. The installation command is very similar to that of conda: pip install &lt;package-name&gt;. Let’s try this out by installing a package that makes conda faster and changing the config to use this package by default:\nconda install conda-libmamba-solver\nconda config --set solver libmamba\nIn the next session we will use conda to install some of the key packages we will use in DSCI 310."

We will use R both in Jupyter notebooks and in RStudio.\n\nR\nThe version of R available in the default Ubuntu repositories is older than the one we will be using in this course. To obtain the latest R packages, we need to add a new repository which is maintained directly by the r-project. To do this, first add the key for this repository by typing the following:\nwget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc\nThen add the URL to the repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/\"\nNext, install r-base and r-base-dev (useful for compiling R packages from source):\nsudo apt install r-base r-base-dev\nAfter installation, type the following in a new terminal window:\nR --version\nYou should see something like this if you were successful:\nR version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16) -- \"Beagle Scouts\"\nCopyright (C) 2023 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\n\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the\nGNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.\nFor more information about these matters see\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\n\nNote: See this page for additoinal instructions if you run into troubles while installing R.\n\n\nNote: Although it is possible to install R through conda, we highly recommend not doing so. In case you have already installed R using conda you can remove it by executing conda uninstall r-base.\n\n\n\nRStudio\nDownload the Ubuntu 22 Desktop version (not Pro) of RStudio from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Open the file and follow the installer instructions.\n\nNote: If you select “open with” and try to open the file directly with the Ubuntu Software app instead of downloading it first, the software app might complain that the file is not supported.\n\nTo see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon or typing rstudio in a terminal.\n\nNote: Since we installed RStudio directly from a deb file rather than from a repository or a snap package, it will not be updated when we run sudo apt upgrade and not automatically as for snap packages. Instead, RStudio will notify you of any available updates when the program is launched.\n\nNow we are going to change RStudio’s Insert Pipe shortcut so that it inserts the new native pipe operator |&gt;. Go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code &gt; Editing and tick the following option:\n\nOnce the change is made you can try in the RStudio console Control + Shift + m to check if works.\nFinally, let’s install a common R package that you used a lot in DSCI 100 by typing the following into the console inside RStudio:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nIRkernel\nThe IRkernel package is needed to make R work in Jupyter notebooks. To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install by pasting the following command into the RStudio Console:\ninstall.packages('IRkernel')\nIRkernel::installspec()\n\nNote: If you see an error message saying “jupyter-client has to be installed…”, close RStudio and run the following line from your terminal instead R -e \"IRkernel::installspec()\".\n\nTo see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel. To launch JupyterLab, type the following in a terminal:\njupyter lab\nA browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on “R” notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.\n\nSometimes a kernel loads, but doesn’t work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type library(tidyverse) in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:\n\nTo improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab, we will add keyboard shortcuts for inserting the common R operators &lt;- and |&gt;. Go to Settings -&gt; Settings Editor. Then click JSON Settings Editor in the top right corner and click on Keyboard Shortcuts in the navigation panel to the left. You will see two panels, the right-most panel allows you to perform advanced modification of keyboards shortcuts in JupyterLab and it already contains quite a few shortcuts. We’re going to add two more shortcuts, by pasting a text snippet just before the first existing shortcut. Go ahead and create a new line just after the line that says \"shortcuts\": [ and paste the following:\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Alt -\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"&lt;- \"}\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Accel Shift M\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"|&gt; \"}\n            }\n        },\nAfter you have pasted this text, hit the small floppy disk in the top right (or Ctrl + s) to save the settings. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like with the settings saved:\n\nTo check that the extension is working, open JupyterLab, launch an R notebook, and try inserting the operators by pressing Alt + - or Shift + Ctrl + m, respectively. You could add any arbitrary text insertion command the same way, but this is all that is required for this course."

Briefly, we will be using the Bash shell to interact with our computers via a command line interface, Git to keep a version history of our files and upload to/download from to GitHub, and Windows Terminal to run the both Bash and Git.\nGo to https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the windows version of git. After the download has finished, run the installer and accept the default configuration for all pages except for the following:\n\nOn the Select Components page, add a Git Bash profile to Windows Terminal.\n\nOn the Choosing the default editor used by Git page, select “Use Visual Studio Code as Git’s default editor” from the drop-down menu’\n\nSet the default branch name to main\n\n\nTo install windows terminal visit this link and click Get to open it in Windows Store. Inside the Store, click Get again and then click Install. After installation, click Launch to start Windows Terminal. In the top of the window, you will see the tab bar with one open tab, a plus sign, and a down arrow. Click the down arrow and select Settings (or type the shortcut Ctrl + ,). In the Startup section, click the dropdown menu under Default profile and select Git Bash.\n\nYou can now launch the Windows terminal from the start menu or pin it to the taskbar like any other program (you can read the rest of the article linked above for additional tips if you wish). To make sure everything worked, close down Windows Terminal, and open it again. Git Bash should open by default, the text should be green and purple, and the tab should read MINGW64:/c/Users/$USERNAME (you should also see /c/Users/$USERNAME if you type pwd into the terminal). This screenshot shows what it should look like:\n\n\nNote: Whenever we refer to “the terminal” in these installation instructions, we want you to use the Windows Terminal that you just installed with the Git Bash profile. Do not use Windows PowerShell, CMD, or anything else unless explicitly instructed to do so.\n\nTo open a new tab you can click the plus sign or use Ctrl + Shift + t (you can close a tab with Ctrl + Shift + w). To copy text from the terminal, you can highlight it with the mouse and then click Ctrl + Shift + c. To paste text you use Ctrl + Shift + v, try it by pasting the following into the terminal to check which version of Bash you just installed:\nbash --version\nThe output should look similar to this:\nGNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (x86_64-pc-msys)\nCopyright (C) 2020 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;\n\nThis is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nNote: If there is a newline (the enter character) in the clipboard when you are pasting into the terminal, you will be asked if you are sure you want to paste since this newline will act as if you pressed enter and run the command. As a guideline you can press Paste anyway unless you are sure you don’t want this to happen.\n\nLet’s also check which version of git was installed:\ngit --version\ngit version 2.42.0.windows.2\n\nNote: Some of the Git commands we will use are only available since Git 2.23, so make sure your if your Git is at least this version.\n\nYou can launch many windows programs from the terminal, e.g. to launch VS Code that we installed previously, you would type in code, let’s use this to check the version of vscode that we installed:\ncode --version\n1.81.1\n6d9b74a70ca9c7733b29f0456fd8195364076dda\nx64\n\nConfiguring Git user info\nNext, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email. To do this, type the following into the terminal (replacing Jane Doe and janedoe@example.com, with your name and email that you used to sign up for GitHub, respectively):\ngit config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\"\ngit config --global user.email janedoe@example.com\n\nNote: To ensure that you haven’t made a typo in any of the above, you can view your global Git configurations by either opening the configuration file in a text editor (e.g. via the command code ~/.gitconfig) or by typing git config --list --global.\n\n\n\nSetting VS Code as the default editor\nTo make programs run from the terminal (such as git) use VS Code by default, we will modify ~/.bash_profile. First, open it using VS Code:\ncode ~/.bash_profile\n\nNote: If you see any existing lines in your ~/.bash_profile related to a previous Python or R installation, please remove these.\n\nAppend the following lines:\n# Set the default editor for programs launch from terminal\nEDITOR=\"code --wait\"\nVISUAL=$EDITOR  # Use the same value as for \"EDITOR\" in the line above\nThen save the file and exit VS Code.\n\nNote: Most terminal programs will read the EDITOR environmental variable when determining which editor to use, but some read VISUAL, so we’re setting both to the same value.\n\nIn some cases, VScode is not set as the default text editor for git even after appending the two lines above, so to make sure it is registered properly, also run the following from your terminal:\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\nOn Windows, VScode sometimes reads a different configuration file than Git Bash. To avoid this, open your ~/.bashrc file:\ncode ~/.bashrc\nAnd append the following line:\n# Do NOT add anything to this file, use `~/.bash_profile` instead.\n# The next line automatically loads your `~/.bash_profile`\n# any time a program tries to read your `~/.bashrc` file.\nif [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then . ~/.bash_profile; fi\nThe comment is a reminder to your future self who might open up this file a few months from now =)\n\n\nSetting Git Bash as the default VS Code terminal profile\nFinally, let’s make sure the VS Code uses our newly installed Git Bash shell as its default terminal profile:\n\nOpen Up VS Code and go to the general preferences / settings (shortcut Ctrl + ,).\nType in “Default terminal profile” and find the entry that reads Terminal &gt; Integrated &gt; Default profile: Windows.\nSelect Git Bash from the drop down menu of this entry.\n\nNow Git Bash should be opened automatically each time you open a new terminal in side VS Code."

To install Python and the conda package manager, we will use the Miniconda platform (read more here), for which the Python 3.x 64-bit version can be downloaded here. After the download has finished, run the installer and accept the default configuration for all pages.\n\nNote: Do not add miniconda to PATH. We will set this up later.\n\nAfter installation, open the Start Menu and search for the program called “Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)”. When this opens you will see a prompt similar to (base) C:\\Users\\your_name. Type the following to check that your Python installation is working:\npython --version\nwhich should return Python 3.11.0 or greater:\nPython 3.11.0\n\n\nIntegrating Python with the Git Bash terminal\nTo avoid having to open the separate Anaconda Prompt every time we want to use Python, we can make it available from the (Git Bash) terminal, which is what we will be using most of the time. To set this up, open the “Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)” again and type:\nconda init bash\nYou will see that this modified a few configuration files, which makes conda visible to the terminal. Close all open terminal windows and launch a new one, you should now see that the prompt string has changed to include the word (base) as in the screenshot below:\n\nIf you type\npython --version\nyou should now see the same output as above:\nPython 3.11.0\nLet’s also check the version of the conda package manager. If you type\nconda --version\nyou should see something like this\nconda 23.5.2\n\nOptional: One annoyance with our current terminal setup is that the word (base) is not on the same row as the rest of the prompt string (the part with your_name@your_computer. To fix this we can edit the .bash_profile configuration file to indicate that we do not want a newline at the beginning of the prompt string. Open up the configuration file using VS Code by typing the following command into a terminal:\ncode \"/c/Program Files/Git/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh\"\nDelete the line that reads the following (it should be line 13):\nPS1=\"$PS1\"'\\n'       # new line\nWhile we are in this file, let’s also remove the line that says PS1=\"$PS1\"'$MSYSTEM '          # show MSYSTEM (line 17), to remove some clutter from the terminal.\nClick to save the file, when VS Code prompts you that the saving failed, click “Retry as Admin” and then “Yes”. That’s it! Now if you launch a new terminal instance, you will see (base) on the same line as the rest of the prompt string as in the screenshot below."

A package needs to go through thorough testing before it is included in the default channel, which is good for stability, but also means that new versions will be delayed and fewer packages are available overall. There is a community-driven effort called the conda-forge (read more here), which provides more up to date packages. To enable us to access the most up to date version of the Python packages we are going to use, we will add the more up to date channel. To add the conda-forge channel by typing the following in the terminal:\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nTo install packages individually, we can now use the following command: conda install &lt;package-name&gt;. After running that command conda will show you the packages that will be downloaded, and you can press enter to proceed with the installation. If you want to answer yes by default and skip this confirmation step, you can replace conda install with conda install -y. Also note that we may occasionally need to install packages using pip, the standard Python package manager. The installation command is very similar to that of conda: pip install &lt;package-name&gt;.\nLet’s try this out by installing a package that makes conda faster and changing the config to use this package by default:\nconda install conda-libmamba-solver\nconda config --set solver libmamba\nIn the next session we will use conda to install some of the key packages we will use in DSCI 310."

Open the file and follow the installer instructions accepting the default configuration.\nAfter the installation is complete, we will add the R executables to the PATH variable in terminal so that you can use it without typing the full path to R each time Open a terminal and type:\ncode ~/.bash_profile\nAppend the following lines to the file\n# Automatically expand the R version number\nR_DIR=(/c/Program\\ Files/R/*/bin/x64)\n# Add R and Rscript to PATH\nexport PATH=\"$R_DIR:$PATH\" # double quote is important here\nThen save the file and exit VS Code. Now you can open a new terminal window and type\nR --version\nwhich should return something like:\nR version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23 ucrt) -- \"Funny-Looking Kid\"\nCopyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\nPlatform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)\n\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the\nGNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.\nFor more information about these matters see\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\n\nNote: Although it is possible to install R through conda, we highly recommend not doing so. In case you have already installed R using conda you can remove it by executing conda uninstall r-base.\n\n\n\nRStudio\nDownload the Windows preview version of RStudio Desktop (not Pro) from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview. Open the file and follow the installer instructions.\nTo see if you were successful, try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon.\nNext, we will make sure that Rstudio uses the same directories as R from terminal for its configuration. To do this, we will need to set an environmental variable in Windows. First, open the start menu, type “env” and select the match that reads “Edit the system environment variables”. Click the button at the bottom that reads “Environmental Variables…”:\n\nUnder “User variable” click the “New…” button:\n\nAnd type in R_USER as the “Variable name” and C:\\Users\\username as the “Variable value”, replacing username with your actual user name (if you don’t know your user name, look at the top of the screenshot above where it says “User variables for your_username”):\n\nClick “OK” on all of the three windows we opened above and you’re done! If you open the console in RStudio and also R from the Windows Terminal (open Windows Terminal, type R, and then press enter) and type the following in both:\n.libPaths()\nboth applications should return the same values, and the first one should be a path inside your user directory e.g.\n\"C:/Users/florencia/R/win-library/4.2\" \"C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.2/library\"\nIf they don’t return the same paths, please try to setting up your environmental variable again and making sure that it is pointing to the correct folder.\nDo not continue unless both R from terminal and R from RStudio return the same paths here or later parts of the installation will fail.\nNow we are going to change RStudio’s Insert Pipe shortcut so that it inserts the new native pipe operator |&gt;. Go to Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Code &gt; Editing and tick the following option:\n\nOnce the change is made you can try in the RStudio console Ctrl + Shift + m to check if works.\nFinally, let’s install a common R package that you used a lot in DSCI 100 by typing the following into the console inside RStudio:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nRtools\nWindows users will also need to install Rtools, which will allow you to use external libraries. Go to http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and download the latest version (e.g., rtools40v2-x86_64.exe). After the download has finished, run the installer with the default configuration. Do not follow the Rtools’ website instructions for “Putting Rtools on the PATH”. RStudio will put Rtools on the PATH automatically when it is needed.\nTo test if your installation was successful, open RStudio (restart it if you already have it open) and type the following into the Console:\ninstall.packages(\"jsonlite\", type = \"source\")\nIf the jsonlite package installs without errors, Rtools is setup correctly.\n\n\nIRkernel\nThe IRkernel package is needed to make R work in Jupyter notebooks. To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install by pasting the following command into the RStudio Console:\ninstall.packages('IRkernel')\nNext, open the Windows terminal and type the following (you can’t use RStudio for this step since it doesn’t honor $PATH changes)\nR -e \"IRkernel::installspec()\"\nTo see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel. To launch the JupyterLab type the following in the terminal:\njupyter lab\nA browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below. Now click on “R” notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.\n\nSometimes a kernel loads, but doesn’t work as expected. To test whether your installation was done correctly now type library(tidyverse) in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell. If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:\n\nTo improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab, we will add keyboard shortcuts for inserting the common R operators &lt;- and |&gt;. Go to Settings -&gt; Settings Editor. Then click JSON Settings Editor in the top right corner and click on Keyboard Shortcuts in the navigation panel to the left. You will see two panels, the right-most panel allows you to perform advanced modification of keyboards shortcuts in JupyterLab and it already contains quite a few shortcuts. We’re going to add two more shortcuts, by pasting a text snippet just before the first existing shortcut. Go ahead and create a new line just after the line that says \"shortcuts\": [ and paste the following:\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Alt -\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"&lt;- \"}\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"command\": \"apputils:run-first-enabled\",\n            \"selector\": \"body\",\n            \"keys\": [\"Accel Shift M\"],\n            \"args\": {\n                \"commands\": [\n                    \"console:replace-selection\",\n                    \"fileeditor:replace-selection\",\n                    \"notebook:replace-selection\",\n                ],\n                \"args\": {\"text\": \"|&gt; \"}\n            }\n        },\nAfter you have pasted this text, hit the small floppy disk in the top right (or Ctrl + s) to save the settings. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like with the settings saved:\n\nTo check that the extension is working, open JupyterLab, launch an R notebook, and try inserting the operators by pressing Alt + - or Shift + Ctrl + m, respectively.

The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.\n 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \"hello-world\" image from the Docker Hub.\n    (amd64)\n 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the\n    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.\n 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it\n    to your terminal.\nTo try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:\n $ docker run -it ubuntu bash\nShare images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:\n https://hub.docker.com/\nFor more examples and ideas, visit:\n https://docs.docker.com/get-started/"

From within VS Code you can open up the Extension Marketplace to browse and install extensions by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar indicated in the figure below.\n\nTo install an extension, you simply search for it in the search bar, click the extension you want, and then click “Install”. There are extensions available to make almost any workflow or task you are interested in more efficient! Here we are interested in setting up VS Code as a Python IDE. To do this, search for and install the following extensions:\n\nPython (everything Python: notebooks, debugging, linting, formatting, etc.)\nmarkdownlint (markdown linting and style checking extension)\nGitLens (powerful extension that extends VS Code’s native git capabilities)\nGit History (intutive view of your git history)\nDocker (easily use Docker from VS Code)\nQuarto (integrated render and preview for Quarto documents and more)\n(Optional) Material Theme and/or Predawn Theme Kit (additional colour themes to choose from)\n(Optional) Material Icon Theme (great-looking custom file icons!)\n\nThis video tutorial is an excellent introduction to using VS Code in Python."

We might ask you to upload this file if we need to troubleshoot your installation, so that we can help you more effectively. If any of your packages are marked as “MISSING” you will need to figure out what is wrong and possibly reinstall them. Once all packages are marked as “OK” we will ask you to submit this log file, so that we can confirm that your installation was successful. Details on where to submit will be provided later.\n\nNote: In general you should be careful running scripts unless they come from a trusted source as in this case (just like how you should be careful when downloading and installing programs on your computer)."

    "text": "This course includes a substantial group project component. You will work in randomly assigned groups of four for the project milestones. There are also individual assignments that act as stepping stones to the project milestones. Given that collaboration is so important in data science, a portion of your final grade will be an assessment of the evidence you provide that you were an effective and productive team member. A combination of peer evaluation and GitHub history will be used to evaluate this. Your individual knowledge on the course materials (concepts and practical skills) will be evaluated on two summative assessments (midterm and final exam).\nFinally, this course is delivered in a blended format, with some pre-work (video watching or reading) expected to be done before each lecture. These will be provided in the course Canvas shell. Each in class lecture session will start with iClicker cloud questions to probe your understanding of the pre-lecture material and then we will work through demonstrations and exercises in class to build off of this.\nIn general, assignments will be due 11:59 PM on Saturdays. However, in the final week of classes, all assignments need to be submitted by the final day of classes, thus we have two alternative due dates that week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nDue Date1\nDue Week\n\n\n\n\nIndividual assignment 1\nSetting up your computer\nJan 18\n2\n\n\nGitHub username quiz\nCreate a GitHub account (if you haven’t already) and let us know what it is\nJan 18\n2\n\n\nIndividual assignment 2\nVersion control practice\nJan 25\n3\n\n\nIndividual assignment 3\nDockerfile practice\nFeb 8\n5\n\n\nMid-term exam2,3\nThe midterm is a summative assessment\nFeb 14\n6\n\n\nMilestone 1\nQuestion, data & rough draft of analysis in one monolithic literate code document, reproducible environment\nMar 1\n8\n\n\nIndividual assignment 4\nReproducible reports practice\nMar 8\n9\n\n\nMilestone 2\nliterate code document broken into scripts and a report & data analysis pipeline to stitch everything together\nMar 15\n10\n\n\nMilestone 3\nfunctions abstracted to a file/module & tests, function documentation\nMar 29\n12\n\n\nPeer review\nreview of another group's project\nApr 5\n13\n\n\nIndividual assignment 5\nPackaging practice\nApr 5\n13\n\n\nFinal project\npackage & CI (the full monty package - including docs)\nApr 11\n14\n\n\nTeam work\nReflection of how the group worked together, as well as individual performance\nApr 11\n14\n\n\nFinal exam2,3,4\nThe Final Exam will include all the material covered in all the components of the course (cumulative).
