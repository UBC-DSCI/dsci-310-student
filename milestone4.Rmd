## Overall project summary

In this course you will work in assigned teams of three or four (see group assignments in [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca)) to answer a predictive question using a publicly available data set that will allow you to answer that question. To answer this question, you will perform a complete data analysis in R and/or Python, from data import to communication of results, while placing significant emphasis on reproducible and trustworthy workflows.

Your data analysis project will evolve throughout the course from a single, monolithic Jupyter notebook, to a fully reproducible and robust data data analysis project, comprised of:

- a well documented and modularized software package and scripts written in R and/or Python,
- a data analysis pipeline automated with GNU Make,
- a reproducible report powered by either Jupyter book or R Markdown,
- a containerized computational environment created and made shareable by Docker, and
- a remote version control repository on GitHub for project collaboration and sharing, as well as automation of test suite execution and documentation and software deployment.

An example final project from another course (where the project is similar) can be seen here: 
-[Breast Cancer Predictor](https://github.com/ttimbers/breast_cancer_predictor)

## Final project summary

In this final project milestone, you will:

1. Abstract project functions to their own software package (this means the code for your project will be split across two repositories)

2. Address any feedback received in earlier milestones

## Final project specifics

### 1. Abstract project functions to their own software package

To further refine your project, you are going to split the code
for your analysis into two version control repositories.
One will be for your analysis, 
the other will be another separate repository, 
that will serve as a place to package up the functions you wrote in milestone 2.
Decoupling these two code bases 
will allow for those functions to more easily be reused in future projects by
you and others who might find them useful!

Your new version control repository for your packaged functions should:

- contain at least 3 or 4 useful functions that handle errors gracefully 
  (you already wrote these - you need to now 
  copy them from your analysis repository to the software package repository)

- be well documented (use the three level of package documentation we learned about in class: function/reference docs, vignette/tutorials docs, and high-level package website docs)

- have unit and integration tests
  (you already wrote these - you need to now 
  copy them from your analysis repository to the software package repository)

- use GitHub actions for continuous integration to run your tests, 
  and continuous deployment to render your package documentation 
  (if you are creating a Python package, 
  you can even use continuous deployment to publish your package to PyPI!)

- have a `README` that describes your package from a high-level, 
  including where it sits in the package ecosystem 
  for the language you chose to write it in chose
  (i.e., what other similar packages exist and how do they differ)

- have a Software Licence 
  that describes how you will permit others to use your work

- have a code of conduct document 
  that describes behavioural expectations of team interactions

- have a contributions document 
  that outlines how the team will work together 
  (expected workflow practices)

You should update your the analysis code in your data analysis repository
so that... 

### 2. Address any feedback received in earlier milestones

Revise your data analysis project to address feedback received
from the DSCI 310 teaching team from past milestones.
50% of your final grade for this milestone will be assessing 
whether you have addressed this feedback to improve your project.

To help us easily, and correctly, assess this, 
please point us to where you have addressed the feedback received
by replying in the issue thread where the feedback was given.
You can point us to evidence of addressing it 
by providing URLs to reference 
specific lines of code, commit messages, pull requests, etc.
Be sure to add some narration when sharing these URLs 
so that it is easy for us to identify which changes to your work 
addressed which pieces of feedback.

## Submission Instructions

You will submit three URLS's to Canvas in the provided text box for milestone 3:

1. the URL of your project's GitHub.com repository
2. the URL of a GitHub release of your project's GitHub.com repository for this milestone.
3. the URL of your software package's repository on GitHub.com

### Creating a release on GitHub.com 
Just before you submit the milestone 4, create a release on your project repository on GitHub and name it something like `4.0.0` ([how to create a release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release)). This release allows us and you to easily jump to the state of your repository at the time of submission for grading puroposes, while you continue to work on your project for the next milestone.

## Expectations

- **Everyone should contribute equally to all aspects of the project**
**(e.g., code, writing, project management).**
**This should be evidenced by a roughly equal number of commits,**
**pull request reviews and participation in communication via GitHub issues.**
- Each group member should work in a 
[GitHub flow workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow); 
where they create branches for each feature or fix, 
which are reviewed and critiqued by at least one other teammate 
before the the pull request is accepted.
- You should be committing to git and pushing to GitHub.com every time you work on this project.
- Git commit messages should be meaningful. These will be marked. 
It's OK if one or two are less meaningful, but most should be.
- Use GitHub issues to communicate to their team mate (as opposed to email or Slack).
- Your question, analysis and visualization should make sense. It doesn't have to be complicated.
- **Your analysis should be correct, and run reproducibly given the instructions provided in the README.**
- You should use proper grammar and full sentences in your README. 
Point form may occur, but should be less than 10% of your written documents.
- R code should follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), 
and Python code should follow the 
[black style guide](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html) for Python)
