The purpose of this individual report
is to give you an avenue to present your viewpoint
as to how the project went,
how the group worked together,
and your role in the group.
Each group member must complete this form
to report on the contributions of **yourself** and the other group members.
That information can be used to adjust final grades of individuals,
if needed.
This is a private report,
meaning that none of your classmates will see your submission.

For each of the sections below,
evaluate each member of your group by writing the number
that best reflects the extent to which they participated,
prepared, helped the group excel, and was a team player.
Use the following ratings:

| Rating | Description                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| 4      | Usually (over 90% of the time)          |
| 3      | Frequently (more often than not)        |
| 2      | Sometimes (less than half the time)     |
| 1      | Rarely (never or once in a great while) |

Below,
briefly describe the specific contributions each team member
made to your project (**including yourself**).
Point form is fine.
Specifically,
comment on the following areas:

- How the team worked together as a whole, including:
    - What was your role in the group?
      That is, what sort of things did you do to contribute to the evolution of the project?
    - What were the roles of others in your group?
- What went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?


My role is a team player in this group. In the first few stages of projects, I mostly performed the tasks assigned on my side and collaborate with the group. I did well on writing the functions and tests on summarize_column on milestone 2, which shows no error and prove to be a robust function. For the final stage of project, I was able to take more of the lead and created our group package project first, created issues and assigned the tasks. I created package website, codecov badge, updated and improved test coverage, etc. Jenna contributed a lot on organzing the tasks, distributing the tasks. Moira and Vera are very good teammates who completed their own tasks and offer help when another teammate needs help on debugging or fixing tests for example.

Most aspects of the team project went very well, we all worked very hard and contributed a lot of time and effort to make it smoothly reproducible. From the beginning stage, we scheduled the zoom meeting on time and leave plenty of time to complete the tasks and perform debugging in cases when there are errors. There're so many packages in our project, thus in this area, we can make some improvements and keep regular checks so that we are more prepared when there is a bug to fix.



## Submission instructions

- Fill out this form
  (editable version of the form available [here](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-student/blob/main/team-work.Rmd))
  and convert it to an `.pdf` document.
  Finally submit it to Canvas.

- If you have any supporting documentation for good or bad communication of your teammbers,
  You may insert them as an image in the document.
  One way you can use this is to put into an R Chunk the `knitr::include_graphics("")` call like we did for your group project.
