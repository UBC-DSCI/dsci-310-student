---

Team work reflection document - contributes to part of the individual team work grade.

*You can access an editable version of this file [here](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-student/blob/main/project/teamwork_feedback.qmd).*

The purpose of this individual report
is to give you an avenue to present your viewpoint
as to how the project went,
how the group worked together,
and your role in the group.
Each group member must complete this form
to report on the contributions of **yourself** and the other group members.
That information can be used to adjust final grades of individuals,
if needed.
This is a private report,
meaning that none of your classmates will see your submission.

For each of the sections below,
evaluate each member of your group by writing the number
that best reflects the extent to which they participated,
prepared, helped the group excel, and was a team player.
Use the following ratings:

| Rating | Description                             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------|
| 4      | Usually (over 90% of the time)          |
| 3      | Frequently (more often than not)        |
| 2      | Sometimes (less than half the time)     |
| 1      | Rarely (never or once in a great while) |

Below,
briefly describe the specific contributions each team member
made to your project (**including yourself**).
Point form is fine.
Specifically,
comment on the following areas:

- How the team worked together as a whole, including:
    - What was your role in the group?
      That is, what sort of things did you do to contribute to the evolution of the project?
    - What were the roles of others in your group?
- What went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?


How the team worked together:
- Collaborated closely and divided work based on each person’s strengths and availability.
- Maintained regular communication via GitHub issues and pull requests.
- Followed GitHub flow with meaningful commits, code reviews, and branching.

My Role (Abner):
- Contributed to both the analysis repo and the package repo.
- Helped abstract core functions into a separate software package and ensured proper documentation.
- Participated in writing validation checks and refining the analysis pipeline.
- Addressed some feedback items and helped polish the final submission.

Kevin’s Role:
- Contributed across repos—especially on technical refinements and code cleaning.
- Assisted with testing, Docker environment updates, and integrating the final report.
- Reviewed and merged pull requests to ensure consistent code quality.

Yuwen’s Role:
- Took a leadership role in setting up and structuring both repositories.
- Initiated work on most milestones, including setting up package infrastructure and Quarto report styling.
- Coordinated task distribution and kept the team on track with deadlines and checklists.

What went well:
- Balanced workload and adaptability with shifting roles across milestones.
- Maintained good communication and collaboration through GitHub tools.
- Everyone contributed meaningfully to both the technical and organizational aspects of the project.

What went poorly:
- We tended to start each milestone a bit late, which sometimes led to rushed work near the submission deadline.
