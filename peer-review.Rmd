## Constructively reviewing data analysis projects

In this assignment, you will get to practice peer review of a data analysis project 
by reviewing a data analysis project created by your classmates.
You will be writing your review in an issue in [this repository](https://github.com/DSCI-310/data-analysis-review-2021). 
You will be evaluated on the thoughtfullness and usefullness of your feedback in the review.

### Submission instructions

In the textbox provided for this assignment on Canvas,
you must submit link to this issue containing your peer review to the "Peer review" assignment on Canvas 
so that the TA can find your review easily.

### Peer review instructions 

- Once an issue is assigned to you, you can start your review. 
You can view the project number you were assigned by searching the issues in [this repository](https://github.com/DSCI-310/data-analysis-review-2021/issues)
for your GitHub username. You should have also received a GitHub notification or email about this assignment.
- Using the review checklist linked to below, review the data analysis project assigned to you and write your comprehensive review. 
    - [data analysis checklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/data-analysis-review-checklist/main/data-analysis-review-checklist.md) 
- Other than checking the boxes in the template, we ask you to give at least 3 pieces of constructive feedback in the `Review Comments` section. 
It is OK to have some overlap with the other people reviewing the data analysis project, but there should be **at least 2 points of constructive feedback unique to each review**. 

### Some guidance when you write your reviews

- Be concrete and specific: support your claims with evidence: provide an example or point to specific things when you write comments.

- Be empathetic: when you write feedback, try to put yourself at the receiving end and think about what feedback would have been useful for you.

- Be Constructive: Do not use evaluative or judgmental language; instead be constructive and help them build on their strengths.

- Tone: Don't be mean. A good test to determine whether you are being mean or not is putting yourself or a close friend at the receiving end or imagining whether you can say it to them in a face-to-face conversation.
