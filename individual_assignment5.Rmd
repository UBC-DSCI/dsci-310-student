## Motivation

The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that everyone 
gains hands-on practice creating software packages in R. 

### Submission instructions

In the textbox provided for this assignment on Canvas,
you must submit a link to the GitHub.com repository containing the R package 
that you create for this assignment.

### Exercise instructions - Create an R Package

Read through, 
and follow all of the prompts in 
[The whole game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html) 
chapter of the R Packages book.
At the end of this chapter, you will have created a toy R package
that lives inside a public repository on GitHub.com.

To ensure your package is working, set your working directory to be directly
inside the repository containing your package and then call
`devtools::load_all()`. If everything is correct, you should now be able
to call `str_split_one()`!

### Exercise instructions - Add a new R function to your package

Now we are going to add a second function to this package.
**Your grade will depend on the correctness of this function.**
Here are the specifications for the function you must add:

  #' Replace ALL instances of "foo" with "bar"
  #'
  #' @param string A character vector.
  #'
  #' @return A character vector.
  #' @export
  #'
  #' @examples
  #' x <- "foo"
  #' str_replace_all_foo(x)
  #'
  #' y <- c("foo", "bar")
  #' str_replace_all_foo(y)
  
Create a new file in the R directory of your package named 
`str_replace_all_foo.R`
and copy and paste the specification above. Implement the function according
to the specification. Feel free to use any function inside the
[`stringr`](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package in your implementation.
You should also add some tests for your new function inside `tests/testthat`.
When you are done, make sure you run `check()` to ensure your tests pass and
the package is working properly.
