## Installation notes

If you have already installed Git, Latex, or any of the R or Python related packages
**please uninstall these and follow the instructions below to reinstall them**
(make sure to also remove any user configuration files and backup them if desired).
In order to be able to support you effectively
and minimize setup issues and software conflicts,
we require all students to install the software stack the same way.

In all the sections below,
if you are presented with the choice to download either a 64-bit (also called x64)
or a 32-bit (also called x86) version of the application **always** choose the 64-bit version.

Once you have completed these installation instructions,
make sure to follow the post-installation notes at the end
to check that all software is setup correctly.

## Ubuntu software settings

To ensure that you are installing the right version of the software in this guide,
open "Software & Updates" and make sure that the boxes in the screenshot are checked
(this is the default configuration).

## Web browser

In DSCI 310 we will be using several tools that work most reliably on Google Chrome and Firefox
(including our online quiz software), so we recommend that you use one of these browsers.

- Firefox comes preinstalled with Ubuntu, so there is not need to download anything.
- To install Chrome, go to [https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/), click on "Download Chrome" choose the deb-file, download it to your computer and click on the downloaded file to install it.

> **Note:** If you select "open with" and try to open the file directly with the Ubuntu Software app instead of downloading it first, the software app might complain that the file is not supported.

## Visual Studio Code

The open-source text editor Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is both
a powerful text editor and a full-blown Python IDE,
which we will use for more complex analysis.
You can install VS Code either via the
[Snap store/Ubuntu software app through this link](https://snapcraft.io/code)
or via the downloadable deb-file from the VS code website
[https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
The getting started instructions are here:
[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb).

You can test that VS code is installed and can be opened from Terminal by restarting terminal and typing the following command:

```bash
code --version
```

you should see something like this if you were successful:

```bash
1.59.0
d5e9aa0227e057a60c82568bf31c04730dc15dcd
x64
```

## GitHub

In DSCI 310 we will use the publicly available [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
If you do not already have an account, please sign up for one at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/)

Sign up for a free account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already.

## Git

We will be using the command line version of Git as well as Git through RStudio and JupyterLab.
Some of the Git commands we will use are only available since Git 2.23,
so if your Git is older than this version,
we ask you to update it using the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

You can check your git version with the following command:

```
git --version
```

### Configuring Git user info

Next, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email.
To do this, type the following into the terminal
(replacing Jane Doe and janedoe@example.com, with your name and email that
you used to sign up for GitHub, respectively):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com
```

> **Note:** To ensure that you haven't made a typo in any of the above,
> you can view your global Git configurations by either opening the
> configuration file in a text editor (e.g. via the command `code ~/.gitconfig`)
> or by typing `git config --list --global`.

### Setting VS Code as the default editor

To make programs run from the terminal (such as `git`) use VS Code by default,
we will modify the bash configuration file `~/.bashrc`. First, open it using VS Code:

```
code ~/.bashrc
```

> **Note:** If you see any existing lines in your `~/.bashrc`
> related to a previous Python or R installation,
> please remove these.

Append the following lines:

```
# Set the default editor for programs launch from terminal
EDITOR="code --wait"
VISUAL=$EDITOR  # Use the same value as for "EDITOR" in the line above

```

Then save the file and exit VS Code.

> **Note:** Most terminal programs will read the `EDITOR` environmental variable
> when determining which editor to use, but some read `VISUAL`,
> so we're setting both to the same value.

In some cases,
VScode is not set as the default text editor for git
even after appending the two lines above,
so to make sure it is registered properly,
also run the following from your terminal:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

## Python, Conda, and JupyterLab

### Python and Conda

In DSCI 310 we will be using Python and the `conda` package manager.
To install Python and the `conda` package manager,
we will use the [Miniconda platform (read more here)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html),
for which the [Python 3.x 64-bit version can be downloaded here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh).

Once the download is finished, open Terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
bash path/to/file
```

> **Note:** Most often this file is downloaded to the `Downloads` directory,
> and thus the command will look like this:
>
>```bash
>bash Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
>```

The instructions for the installation will then appear:

1. Press Enter.
2. Once the licence agreement shows, you can press space scroll down, or press `q` to skip reading it.
3. Type `yes` and press enter to accept the licence agreement.
4. Press enter to accept the default installation location.
5. Type `yes` and press enter to instruct the installer to run `conda init`, which makes `conda` available from the terminal/shell.

After installation, restart the terminal. If the installation was successful,
you will see `(base)` prepending to your prompt string. 
To confirm that `conda` is working, you can ask it which version was installed:
```bash
conda --version
```
which should return something like this:

```bash
conda 4.10.3
```

Next, type the following to ask for the version of Python:
```bash
python --version
```
which should return Python 3.9.0 or greater:

```
Python 3.9.5
```

> **Note:** If instead you see `Python 2.7.X` you installed the wrong version.
> Uninstall the Miniconda you just installed (which usually lives in the `/home/<USER>` directory),
> and try the installation again, selecting **Python 3.9**.


## Installing Python packages

`conda` installs Python packages from different online repositories which are called "channels".
A package needs to go through thorough testing before it is included in the default channel,
which is good for stability,
but also means that new versions will be delayed and fewer packages are available overall.
There is a community-driven effort called the [conda-forge (read more here)](https://conda-forge.org/),
which provides more up to date packages.
To enable us to access the most up to date version of the Python packages we are going to use,
we will add the more up to date channel.
To add the conda-forge channel by typing the following in the terminal:

```bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

To install packages individually,
we can now use the following command:
`conda install <package-name>`.
After running that command
`conda` will show you the packages that will be downloaded,
and you can press enter to proceed with the installation.
If you want to answer `yes` by default and skip this confirmation step,
you can replace `conda install` with `conda install -y`.
Also note that we may occasionally need to install packages using `pip`,
the standard Python package manager.
The installation command is very similar to that of `conda`: `pip install <package-name>`.
Let's try this out in the next section,
by installing some of the key packages we will use in MDS.

## JupyterLab setup

`JupyterLab` is a coding environment that we will be using frequently
throughout the course and `pandas` is one of the key Python data analyses packages.
The Jupytext Python package and the JupyterLab git extension facilitates
using notebooks in JupyterLab together with Git & GitHub.
The spellchecker helps us correcting typos in our writing
and the LSP packages fill the same function for our code.
Install them via the following commands:

```bash
conda install pandas jupyterlab jupyterlab-git jupyterlab-spellchecker jupytext jupyterlab-lsp jupyter-lsp-python
```

To test that your JupyterLab installation is functional,
you can type `jupyter lab` into a terminal,
which should open a new tab in your default browser with the JupyterLab interface.
To exit out of JupyterLab you can click `File -> Shutdown`,
or go to the terminal from which you launched JupyterLab and hold `Ctrl` while pressing `c` twice.

## R, IRkernel, and RStudio

R is the second language that we will be using frequently in this course.
We will use R both in Jupyter notebooks and in RStudio.

### R

The version of R available in the default Ubuntu repositories is older
than the one we will be using in this course.
To obtain the latest R packages,
we need to add a new repository which is maintained directly by the r-project.
To do this, first add the key for this repository by typing the following:

```bash
wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc
```

Then add the URL to the repository:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/"
```

Next, install `r-base` and `r-base-dev` (useful for compiling R packages from source):

```bash
sudo apt install r-base r-base-dev
```

After installation, type the following in a new terminal window:
```bash
R --version
```

You should see something like this if you were successful:

```
R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31 ucrt) -- "Innocent and Trusting"
Copyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
You are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the
GNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.
For more information about these matters see
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.
```

> **Note:** [See this page for additoinal instructions if you run into troubles while installing R](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/).

> **Note:** Although it is possible to install R through conda,
> we highly recommend not doing so. In case you have already installed R using
> conda you can remove it by executing `conda uninstall r-base`.

### RStudio

Download the Ubuntu 18/Debian 10 Desktop version (not Pro) of RStudio Preview from
[https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).
Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

> **Note:** There is not yet an official RStudio version for Ubuntu 20.04,
> so it is recommended to use the Ubuntu 18 version.
> Also note that if you select "open with" and try to open the file directly
> with the Ubuntu Software app instead of downloading it first,
> the software app might complain that the file is not supported.

To see if you were successful,
try opening RStudio by clicking on its icon or typing `rstudio` in a terminal.

> **Note:** Since we installed RStudio directly from a deb file rather than
> from a repository or a snap package,
> it will not be updated when we run `sudo apt upgrade`
> and not automatically as for snap packages.
> Instead, RStudio will notify you of any available updates when the program is launched.

Now we are going to change RStudio’s *Insert Pipe* shortcut so that it inserts
the [new native pipe operator `|>`](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/06/09/rstudio-v1-4-update-whats-new/). 
Go to `Tools > Global Options > Code > Editing` and tick the following option:

![](resources/native_pipe.png)

Once the change is made you can try in the RStudio console `Control` + `Shift` + `m` to check if works.

### Installing R packages

The `tidyverse` R package (and some others) have external dependencies on Ubuntu outside of R.
We need to install these first before we install such R packages:

```
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev
```

Next, install the key R packages needed for the course by opening up RStudio and
typing the following into the R console inside RStudio:

```R
install.packages(c("cowplot", "GGally", "kknn", "scales", "tidyverse", "tidymodels"))
```
### IRkernel

The `IRkernel` package is needed to make R work in Jupyter notebooks.
To enable this kernel in the notebooks, install by pasting the following command into the RStudio Console:

```R
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()
```

> **Note:** If you see an error message saying "jupyter-client has to be installed...",
> close RStudio and run the following line from your terminal instead `R -e "IRkernel::installspec()"`.

To see if you were successful, try running JupyterLab and check if you have a working R kernel.
To launch JupyterLab, type the following in a terminal:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

A browser should have launched and you should see a page that looks like the screenshot below.
Now click on "R" notebook (circled in red on the screenshot below) to launch an JupyterLab with an R kernel.

![](resources/jupyterlab_r_kernel.png)

Sometimes a kernel loads, but doesn't work as expected.
To test whether your installation was done correctly now type `library(tidyverse)`
in the code cell and click on the run button to run the cell.
If your R kernel works you should see something like the image below:

![](resources/jupyterlab_r_kernel2.png)

To improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab,
we will add keyboard shortcuts for inserting the common R operators `<-` and `|>`.
Go to `Settings -> Advanced Settings Editor -> Keyboard Shortcuts`
and paste the following in the rightmost panel that says `User Preferences`
(replacing the `{}`):

```json
{
    "shortcuts": [
        {
            "command": "apputils:run-first-enabled",
            "selector": "body",
            "keys": ["Alt -"],
            "args": {
                "commands": [
                    "console:replace-selection",
                    "fileeditor:replace-selection",
                    "notebook:replace-selection",
                ],
                "args": {"text": "<- "}
            }
        },
        {
            "command": "apputils:run-first-enabled",
            "selector": "body",
            "keys": ["Accel Shift M"],
            "args": {
                "commands": [
                    "console:replace-selection",
                    "fileeditor:replace-selection",
                    "notebook:replace-selection",
                ],
                "args": {"text": "|> "}
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

After you have pasted this text,
hit the small floppy disk in the top right (or `Ctrl` + `s`)
to save the settings.
Here is a screenshot of what it looks like with the settings saved:

![](resources/jupyterlab_shortcuts.png)

To check that the extension is working,
open JupyterLab,
launch an R notebook,
and try inserting the operators by pressing `Alt` + `-` or `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `m`, respectively.
You could add any arbitrary text insertion command the same way,
but this is all that is required for MDS.

## LaTeX

We will install the lightest possible version of LaTeX and its necessary
packages as possible so that we can render Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents to html and PDF.
If you have previously installed LaTeX, please uninstall it before proceeding with these instructions.

First, open RStudio and run the following commands to install the `tinytex` package and setup `tinytex`:

```R
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

The above is all we need to have LaTeX work with R Markdown documents,
however for Jupyter we need to add the TinyTex executables to our `PATH`
and install several more packages
(`PATH` is a collection of directories which contain the available executable programs on your computer).

To append the TinyTex executables to our `PATH` we need to edit our `.bashrc` file.
The TinyTex executables are usually installed in `~/bin`.
Thus, add the lines below to the bottom of your `.bashrc` file
(which you can open by `code ~/.bashrc`) and save the file:

```
# Append TinyTex executables to the path
export PATH="$PATH:~/bin"
```

When you launch a new terminal instance, this directory will have been added to your path
(you can check this by running `echo $PATH` in the terminal).
Now you can check that the latex installation is working
by opening a terminal and asking for the version of latex:

```bash
latex --version
```

You should see something like this if you were successful:

```
pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.21 (TeX Live 2020)
kpathsea version 6.3.2
Copyright 2020 Han The Thanh (pdfTeX) et al.
There is NO warranty.  Redistribution of this software is
covered by the terms of both the pdfTeX copyright and
the Lesser GNU General Public License.
For more information about these matters, see the file
named COPYING and the pdfTeX source.
Primary author of pdfTeX: Han The Thanh (pdfTeX) et al.
Compiled with libpng 1.6.37; using libpng 1.6.37
Compiled with zlib 1.2.11; using zlib 1.2.11
Compiled with xpdf version 4.02
```

Next, install the additional LaTeX packages needed for Jupyter
by pasting the following into the new terminal instance and press enter:

```
tlmgr install eurosym \
  adjustbox \
  caption \
  collectbox \
  enumitem \
  environ \
  fp \
  jknapltx \
  ms \
  parskip \
  pgf \
  rsfs \
  tcolorbox \
  titling \
  trimspaces \
  ucs \
  ulem \
  upquote \
  lwarp \
  oberdiek \
  pgfplots \
  bbm-macros \
  cmap \
  polyglossia \
  gnu-freefont \
  fncychap \
  wrapfig \
  capt-of \
  needspace \
  tabulary \
  varwidth \
  fancyhdr \
  titlesec \
  ucharclasses
```

To test that your latex installation is working with jupyter notebooks,
launch `jupyter lab` from a terminal and open either a new notebook
or the same one you used to test IRkernel above.
Go to `File -> Export notebook as... -> Export Notebook to PDF`.
If the PDF file is created,
your LaTeX environment is set up correctly.

### WebPDF export

Jupyter recently added another way to export notebooks to PDF
which does not require Latex
and makes the exported PDF look similar to notebooks exported to HTML.
This requires the `pyppeteer` package,
which we can install as follows.

```bash
conda install pyppeteer
pyppeteer-install
```

Try this by going to `File -> Export notebook as... -> Export Notebook to WebPDF`.

## Docker

You will use Docker to create reproducible,
sharable, and shippable computing environments for your analyses.
For this you will need a Docker account.
You can [sign up for a free one here](https://store.docker.com/signup?next=%2F%3Fref%3Dlogin).

After signing-up and signing into the Docker Store, go here:
[https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)
and click on the "Get Docker" button on the right hand side of the screen.
Then, follow the installation instructions on that screen to install the stable version.

Next, [follow the Linux post installation steps here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
so that you can run Docker without typing `sudo`
(only the subheading "Managing docker as a non-root user").
Confirm that docker is working by following the verification instructions on that same page.

## Post-installation notes

You have completed the installation instructions, well done 🙌!
We have created a script to help you check that your installation was successful,
and to provide instructions for how you can troubleshoot any potential issues.
To run this script,
please execute the following command from your terminal.

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-student/main/src/check_setup.sh)
```

The output from running the script will look something like this:

````
# DSCI 310 setup check 1.0

If a program or package is marked as MISSING,
this means that you are missing the required version of that program or package.
Either it is not installed at all or the wrong version is installed.
The required version is indicated with a number and an asterisk (*),
e.g. 4.* means that all versions starting with 4 are accepted (4.0.1, 4.2.5, etc).

You can run the following commands to find out which version
of a program or package is installed (if any):
```
name_of_program --version  # For system programs
conda list  # For Python packages
R -q -e "installed.packages()[,c(Package, Version)]"  # For R packages
```

Checking program and package versions...
