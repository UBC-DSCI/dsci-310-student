# Tutorial 3: Group Project Setup

**Tip:** You can check your team number and teammates in the people tab on Canvas: [https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/89629/groups#tab-46672](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/106514/groups#tab-57184)

## Part 1: (20 min) Set up a GitHub repo for your project

In the same team:
1. (Only one of you) Create a project repo in your github account
    - Name your repository: `dsci-310-group-XX-<optional_team_name>`
3. (Only one of you) Add the other members as collaborators
    - Settings > Collaborators and teams > add people
4. (Only one of you) Set up a GitHub board
    - Projects > Link a project > Board
    - Add other members to the board
5. (Everybody together) Create some GitHub issues and assign tasks
6. That is your project repo!
7. Paste your full github url into the class collaborative document hackmd page (slack > general > pinned on top)
8. Join the corresponding slack channel for your group
9. Put a link to your github repository as a bookmark on the top of your channel

Example tasks for the board:

- join slack
- join slack project channel
- add github project URL to class HackMD document
- add github project URL to slack group channel bookmark

Notes:
- The project repo can be public or private. But if you set the repo to private, you must add the instruction team (`chendaniely`, `a-kong`, `gzzen` and `tonyliang19`) as collaborators with read access to your repo.

## Part 2: (30 min) Draft a team work contract

In your team of 3~4:
1. Spend 5~7 minutes in silence, and during this time, each team member comes up with 3 things to contribute to the team work contract
1. Paste all items from all group members into a collaborative document (e.g., Google docs, Microsoft word using UBC's Microsoft teams)
1. Organize items that are similar
1. Discuss each group of items, and discuss which you agree to keep, and which you do not
1. That is your teamwork contract!
1. (optional) In your github repository put your teamwork contract in your `README.md` file under a section called `## Teamwork Contract`
    - You will need this text for your milestone 1 submission
