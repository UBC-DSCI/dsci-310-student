# Part 1: (30 min) Draft a team work contract

In your team of 3~4:
1. Spend 5~7 minutes in silence, and during this time, each team member comes up with 3 things to contribute to the team work contract.
1. Paste all items from all group members into a collaborative document (e.g., Google docs, Microsoft word using UBC's Microsoft teams, Software Carpentry hack pad: https://pad.carpentries.org/)
1. Organize items that are similar
1. Discuss each group of items, and discuss which you agree to keep, and which you do not
1. That is your teamwork contract!

Notes:
- I (the TA) will go through the breakout rooms to help you

# Part 2: (15~20 min) Set up a GitHub repo for your project

In the same team:
1. (Only one of you) Create a project repo in the **UBC-DSCI 310 ORG** (https://github.com/DSCI-310)
1. (Only one of you) Add the other members as colaborators
1. That is your project repo!

Suggestions (highly recomended):
- Create GitHub issues and assign tasks
- Set up a GitHub board

Notes:
- The project repo can be public or private. But if you set the repo to private, you must add us (Tiffany and Giuseppe) as collaborators with read access to your repo.
