# Tutorial 3

**Tip:** You can check your team number and teammates in the people tab on Canvas: https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/89629/groups#tab-46672

## Part 1: (30 min) Draft a team work contract

In your team of 3~4:
1. Spend 5~7 minutes in silence, and during this time, each team member comes up with 3 things to contribute to the team work contract
1. Paste all items from all group members into a collaborative document (e.g., Google docs, Microsoft word using UBC's Microsoft teams, Software Carpentry hack pad: https://pad.carpentries.org/)
1. Organize items that are similar
1. Discuss each group of items, and discuss which you agree to keep, and which you do not
1. That is your teamwork contract!

Notes:
- I (the TA) will bounce between breakout rooms to see if anyone has questions or needs help
- After 30 minutes, I (the TA) will call you back from the breakout rooms to explain the next part

## Part 2: (20 min) Set up a GitHub repo for your project

In the same team:
1. (Only one of you) Create a project repo in the **UBC-DSCI 310 ORG** (https://github.com/DSCI-310)
1. (Only one of you) Add the other members as colaborators
1. (Only one of you) Set up a GitHub board
1. (Everybody together) Create some GitHub issues and assign tasks
1. That is your project repo!

Notes:
- The project repo can be public or private. But if you set the repo to private, you must add us (ttimbers and GiuseppeTT) as collaborators with read access to your repo.
- I (the TA) will bounce between breakout rooms to see if anyone has questions or needs help
- After you assign the tasks, you are free to go : )
