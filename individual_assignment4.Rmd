## Instructions

The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that everyone gains hands-on practice on creating reproducible reports in R Markdown. 
This assignment also contains an optional added challenge to gain practice with Jupyter book as well. 
If students complete the optional challenge, they get a 10% bonus mark on this assignment (so the highest possible mark is 110%).

### Submission instructions

In the textbox provided for this assignment on Canvas,
you must submit: 
1. A link to the GitHub.com repository that you create for this assignment.

### Exercise instructions

1. Create a copy of [this template repository](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-individual-assignment-repro-reports) on GitHub.com under your personal username.

2. Get familiar with the repository (you can ignore the `doc/jbook_example` directory if you are not completing the optional assignment). 
Inside the [ template repository](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/dsci-310-individual-assignment-repro-reports), 
there are several directories and files. Here is a quick rundown of each:

  - `data`: contains data used in the analysis **(do not edit)**
  - `doc/rmd_example`: contains the (incomplete) RMD version of the analysis
    - `references.bib`: BibTeX references file for the report **(do not edit)**
    - `rmd_example.rmd`: R Markdown containing the contents of the report and its
    configuration **(incomplete)**
  - `makefile`: declares commands used to build the Jupyter Book and RMD report **(do not edit**)
  - `results`: output of the script in `source`
  - `source/generate_figures.R`: a script that performs the analysis and outputs
    various plots and a table that are to be used in the report **(do not edit)**

3. Edit `doc/rmd_example/rmd_example.rmd` so that:
