## Instructions

The purpose of this assignment is to ensure that everyone gains hands-on practice on creating Docker images from `Dockerfile`s. 

### Submission instructions

In the textbox provided for this assignment on Canvas,
you must submit: 
1. A link to the GitHub.com repository that you create for this assignment.
You should name your GitHub.com repository `dockerfile-practice`.
2. A the link to your Docker image on DockerHub. You should name your DockerHub repository `dockerfile-practice`.

### Exercise instructions

1. Create a public repository on GitHub.com repo under your personal username called `dockerfile-practice`

2. Add a `Dockerfile` to it. This Dockerfile should:
    - Be based off of the `ubcdsci/jupyterlab` Docker image ([link to `ubcdsci/jupyterlab` DockerHub repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ubcdsci/jupyterlab), [link to `ubcdsci/jupyterlab` Dockerfile](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/jupyterlab/blob/main/Dockerfile))
    - Add at least one new R or Python package to the Dockerfile (ensure that you pin the version of the package you add).

3. Add a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the image, push it to DockerHub, and version the image and GitHub repo when changes are pushed to the Dockerfile ([link to a GitHub Actions Workflow you should use for this](https://github.com/ttimbers/dockerfile-practice/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish_docker_image.yml)).

  - *Note 1: When setting up the workflow on GitHub Actions, be sure to click "Skip this and setup a workflow yourself".*
  - *Note 2: You will need to add your DockerHub username and password (naming them `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`, respectively) as GitHub secrets to this repository for this to work.*

4. Make sure you make at least one change to the `Dockerfile` once the GitHub Actions have been setup so that you get the image automatically built and pushed to DockerHub at least once.

## Rubric 

This assignment will be graded for completion as follows:

|Grade | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 100% | 1. A Docker image named `dockerfile-practice` and tagged with a version exists under the student's username on DockerHub. 2. The Dockerfile used to create the Docker image lives in a GitHub repository named `dockerfile-practice` under the student's username. 3. There is evidence that a GitHub Actions workflow can successfully build a Docker image from the Dockerfile in the GitHub repository, and publish it to DockerHub. 4. The Docker image version tag is in sync with the GitHub repository release tag. |
| 75%  | 3/4 of the criteria listed above were met. |
| 50%  | 2/4 of the criteria listed above were met. |
| 25%  | 1/4 of the criteria listed above were met. |
| 0%   | Not attempted. |
