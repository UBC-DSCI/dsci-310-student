## Course description

Data science methods to automate the running and testing of code and
analytic reports, manage data analysis software dependencies, package
and deploy software for data analysis, and collaborate with others using
version control.

**Pre-reqs:** DSCI 100 and either (a) one of CPSC 203, CPSC 210, CPEN
221 or (b) one of MATH 210, ECON 323 and one of CPSC 107, CPSC 110.

[www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,414](https://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,414)*

**Long version:** Data Science skills and tools are increasingly in
demand across a large variety of disciplines. DSCI 310 aims to further
students’ existing data science knowledge with reproducible and
trustworthy workflows in the areas of creating and deploying data
analysis, reports, and software. Particular focus will be placed on
teaching the skills and tools currently used in academic research and
industry settings.

Without deliberate and conscious effort towards project organization,
tool choice, and workflows, complex and large data science projects can
quickly grow out-of-hand and become irreproducible and untrustworthy.
This course will focus on reproducible and trustworthy workflows for
writing computer scripts, analytic reports and data analysis pipelines,
as well as packaging, automated testing and deployment of software
written for data analysis. An emphasis is also placed on how to
collaborate effectively with others using version control tools, such as
Git and GitHub. Such workflows act to mitigate chaos and maximize
transparency, reproducibility, and productivity.

While the course will be based on the use of the two leading languages
in data science, Python and R, and related current tools (conda, Docker,
Git, GitHub, Jupyter, etc.), the concepts and skills taught in the
course aim to be discipline and tool agnostic, focussing on the
importance of reproducible and trustworthy workflows for data analysis
and the implications of failing to implement these when performing a
data analysis.

Students who have completed this course will be able to complete complex
data analysis projects with minimal technical debt – meaning that others
can transparently follow how the analysis was done, reproduce the
analysis for themselves if desired, and easily pickup on, and further
extend the analysis in new areas. Strategies for collaboration on data
science projects will also be emphasized.

## Textbook

We will be using a collection of resources available online. These
include:

-   [DSCI 310 course
    notes](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/reproducible-and-trustworthy-workflows-for-data-science)
-   [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)
-   [Python packages](https://py-pkgs.org/)

## Hardware & software

Students are required to bring a laptop to both lectures and tutorials.
Students who do not own a laptop, chromebook, or tablet may be able to
[loan a laptop from the UBC
library](https://services.library.ubc.ca/computers-technology/technology-borrowing/).

## Course-level learning outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1.  Defend and justify the importance of creating data science workflows
    that are reproducible and trustworthy and the elements that go into
    such a workflow (e.g., writing clear, robust, accurate and
    reproducible code, managing and sharing compute environments,
    defined collaboration strategies, etc).
2.  Constructively criticize the workflows and data analysis of others
    in regards to its reproducibility and trustworthiness.
3.  Develop a data science project (including code and non-code
    documents such as reports) that uses reproducible and trustworthy
    workflows
4.  Demonstrate how to effectively share and collaborate on data science
    projects and software by creating robust code packages, using
    reproducible compute environments, and leveraging collaborative
    development tools.
5.  Defend and justify the benefit of, and employ automated testing
    regimes, continuous integration and continuous deployment for
    managing and maintaining data science projects and packages.
6.  Demonstrate strong communication, teamwork, and collaborative skills
    by working on a significant data science project with peers
    throughout the course.

## Teaching team

*Note that your TAs are students too; they may have class right before
their office hours, and they may run a few minutes late. Please be
patient!*

## Assessment

### Course breakdown

This course includes a substantial group project component.
You will work in randomly assigned groups of four for the project milestones. 
There are also individual assignments 
that act as stepping stones to the project milestones.
Given that collaboration is so important in data science, 
a portion of your final grade will be an assessment of the evidence you provide 
that you were an effective and productive team member.
A combination of peer evaluation 
and GitHub history will be used to evaluate this.
Your individual knowledge on the course materials 
(concepts and practical skills)
will be evaluated on two summative assessments (midterm and final exam).

Finally, this course is delivered in a blended format, 
with some pre-work (video watching or reading) 
expected to be done before each lecture.
These will be provided in the course Canvas shell.
Each in class lecture session will start with iClicker cloud
questions to probe your understanding of the pre-lecture material
and then we will work through demonstrations 
and exercises in class to build off of this.

## Policies

### Code of Conduct

All participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing, you are expected to read and follow the [DSCI 310 Code of Conduct](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/dsci-310-student/coc.html).

### Late registration

Students who register for the class late have 1 week from their
registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.

### Late assignments / mid-term exam absence

Students **must be present** at the invigilation venue (in class, on
Zoom, examination centre, etc) to take the mid-term exam; otherwise they
will be considered to have missed the mid-term exam and will be assigned
a grade of zero.

Students who will miss the mid-term exam **must provide a
self-declaration prior to the mid-term exam** and make arrangements
(e.g., schedule an oral make-up mid-term exam) with the Instructor.
Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before
the mid-term exam will result in a grade of zero.

A late submission is defined as any work submitted after the deadline.
For a late submission, the student will receive a 75% scaling of their
grade for the first occurrence, 50% scaling of their grade for the
second occurrence, and will receive a grade of 0 for subsequent
occurrences.

Students who miss an assignment or quiz can request an academic
concession. From the [UBC Senate policy on academic
concession](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20190515_V_135_Academic_Concession-Approved.pdf),
grounds for academic concession can be illness, conflicting
responsibilities, or compassionate grounds. Examples of compassionate
grounds, from the above policy, include “a traumatic event experienced
by the student, a family member, or a close friend; an act of sexual
assault or other sexual misconduct experienced by the student, a family
member, or a close friend; a death in the family or of a close friend.”

To request an academic concession, students should immediately email a
completed and signed [academic concession form to the course
Instructor](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/UBC-MDS.github.io/blob/master/img/Template%20-%20In-Term%20Academic%20Concessions%20Self%20Declaration.pdf?raw=1).
Upon receiving the form, the Instructor will make a decision about how
to proceed. Failure to present valid documentation may result in a
failing grade.

### Re-grading

If you have concerns about the way your work was graded, please contact
the TA who graded it within one week of having the grade returned to you
through Piazza. After this one-week window, we may deny your request for
re-evaluation. Also, please keep in mind that your grade may go up or
down as a result of re-grading.

### Missed final exam

Students who miss the final quiz must report to their faculty advising
office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting
documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred
standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if
possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you
know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams
will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received
deferred standing from their faculty.

### Academic concession policy

Please see [UBC's concession
policy](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,329,0,0)
for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework, quizzes, and
exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.

### Academic integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know,
understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic
integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original
work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas
and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should
not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations
of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the
academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh
sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating
may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious
consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s
Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in
order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the
University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic
Calendar at
<http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0>.

### Plagiarism

Students must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by
someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases
of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:

-   the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or
    minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)
-   the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to
    another
-   the generation of code by automatic code-generation software

An "adequate acknowledgement" requires a detailed identification of the
(parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original
source code that has been reused.

The above attribution policy applies only to assignments. **No code or
text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during
a quiz or exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum,
copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related question.**

**Repeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties,
including failure of the course.**
